> Given this level of discrimination, it is no surprise that many of us choose to throw ourselves with a vengeance into our careers. Focusing on work to the exclusion of almost everything else is a plausible enough strategy in a world which accepts workplace achievements as the main tokens with which we can secure not just the financial means to survive physically, but also the attention that we require to thrive psychologically

> these talking points would be carefully crafted for a specific purpose, to coax guests away from customary expressions of superbia ( ‘What do you do? ’, ‘Where do your children go to school? ’ ) and towards a more sincere revelation of themselves ( ‘What do you regret? ’, ‘Whom can you not forgive? ’, ‘What do you fear? ’ ).

> We no longer have to be brought into line by the threat of hell or the promise of paradise; we merely have to be reminded that it is we ourselves– that is, the most mature and reasonable parts of us ( seldom present in the midst of our crises and obsessions )– who want to lead the sort of life which we once imagined supernatural beings demanded of us.

Anna Karenina and Madame Bovary would thus be assigned in a course on understanding the tensions of marriage instead of in one focused on narrative trends in nineteenth- century fiction, just as the recommendations of Epicurus and Seneca would appear in the syllabus for a course about dying rather than in a survey of Hellenistic philosophy.

# Tenderness
Location 1314

> At such moments we may long to be held and reassured, as we were decades ago by some sympathetic adult, most likely our mother, a person who made us feel physically protected, stroked our hair, looked at us with benevolence and tenderness and perhaps said not very much other than, very quietly, ‘of course ’.

# Art
Location 1665

> From the fourteenth century to the end of the nineteenth, a brotherhood in Rome was renowned for tracking down prisoners on their way to the gallows and placing before their eyes tavolette, or small boards bearing images from the Christian story– usually of Christ on the Cross or the Virgin and Child– in the hope that these representations would bring the condemned solace in their final minutes. It is difficult to conceive of a more extreme example of a belief in the redemptive capacity of images, and yet the brotherhood was only carrying out a mission to which Christian art has always been committed: that of putting examples of the most important ideas in front of us at difficult moments, to help us to live and to die.

# Architecture
Location 1942

> What if our minds are susceptible to more than just the books we read? What if we are also influenced by the houses, hospitals and factories around us? Might we not hence have good reason to mount protests against ugliness– and, despite a thousand obstacles, strive to put up buildings that could advance a case for goodness through their beauty?

> In his Republic, Plato conveyed a touching understanding ( born from experience ) of the limits of the lone intellectual, when he remarked that the world would not be set right until philosophers became kings, or kings philosophers.
