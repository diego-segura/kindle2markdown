I was seeking Brahman , Atman , I wished to destroy myself , to get away from myself , in order to find in the unknown innermost , the nucleus of all things , Atman , Life , the Divine , the Absolute .

At that moment , when the world around him melted away , when he stood alone like a star in the heavens , he was overwhelmed by a feeling of icy despair , but he was more firmly himself than ever .

At that moment he heard his inward voice and the voice said “ No ! ” Then all the magic disappeared from the young woman’s smiling face ; he saw nothing but the ardent glance of a passionate young woman . Gently he stroked her cheek and quickly disappeared from the disappointed woman into the bamboo wood .</h3>

Kamala kept a small rare songbird in a small golden cage . It was about this bird that he dreamt . This bird , which usually sang in the morning , became mute , and as this surprised him , he went up to the cage and looked inside . The little bird was dead and lay stiff on the floor . He took it out , held it a moment in his hand and then threw it away on the road , and at the same moment he was horrified and his heart ached as if he had thrown away with this dead bird all that was good and of value in himself .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Samsara &gt; Page 68 &middot; Location 759</div><div class='noteText'>Then Siddhartha knew that the game was finished , that he could play it no longer .

He remembered how once , as a youth , he had compelled his father to let him go and join the ascetics , how he had taken leave of him , how he had gone and never returned . Had not his father also suffered the same pain that he was now suffering for his son ? Had not his father died long ago , alone , without having seen his son again ? Did he not expect the same fate ? Was it not a comedy , a strange and stupid thing , this repetition , this course of events in a fateful circle ?</h3>
