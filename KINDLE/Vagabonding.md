# I. Vagabonding
Page 4 - Location 273

> purchasing a package vacation to find a simpler life is kind of like using a mirror to see what you look like when you aren’t looking into the mirror. All that is really sold is the romantic notion of a simpler life, and— just as no amount of turning your head or flicking your eyes will allow you to unselfconsciously see yourself in the looking glass— no combination of one- week or ten- day vacations will truly take you away from the life you lead at home.

> Work is not just an activity that generates funds and creates desire; it’s the vagabonding gestation period, wherein you earn your integrity, start making plans, and get your proverbial act together. Work is a time to dream about travel and write notes to yourself, but it’s also the time to tie up your loose ends. Work is when you confront the problems you might otherwise be tempted to run away from. Work is how you settle your financial and emotional debts— so that your travels are not an escape from your real life but a discovery of your real life.

> To actualize this power, we merely need to make strategic use ( if only for a few weeks or months ) of a time- honored personal- freedom technique, popularly known as “quitting. ”

> As Pico Iyer pointed out, the act of quitting “means not giving up, but moving on; changing direction not because something doesn’t agree with you, but because you don’t agree with something. It’s not a complaint, in other words, but a positive choice, and not a stop in one’s journey, but a step in a better direction. Quitting— whether a job or a habit— means taking a turn so as to be sure you’re still moving in the direction of your dreams. ”

> Indeed, the freedom to go vagabonding has never been determined by income level; it’s found through simplicity— the conscious decision of how to use what income you have.

> As with, say, giving up coffee, simplifying your life will require a somewhat difficult consumer withdrawal period. Fortunately, your impending travel experience will give you a very tangible and rewarding long- term goal that helps ease the discomfort. Over time, as you reap the sublime rewards of simplicity, you’ll begin to wonder how you ever put up with such a cluttered life in the first place.

> Here’s a fun, money- saving trick I use: I give up some luxury at home, and instead visualize an experience I could only have on the road. Instead of going out for steak, I picture the sushi I could be eating in Osaka. Instead of buying another guitar, I envision scuba diving a coral reef in the Philippines. The imagination is a powerful tool. I use it to feast on all the possibilities awaiting me on my trip— and my wallet never leaves my pocket.— DEREK ORTH, 28, VOICE ACTOR, FLORIDA

> Never check into a room without asking to see it first. Check to see that the electricity and water work properly, and make sure the door locks are functional. Note the location of your room in relation to discos, mosques, factories, major streets, or other surroundings that might prove noisy at certain times of the day or night.

> My students seemed to enjoy this unusual study environment, but they always clammed up when I referred to them as my “friends. ” “We are not your friends, ” one studious sophomore insisted. “We will never be your friends. ” Her response, which I initially took as hostility toward me as a non- Korean, left me feeling depressed. It wasn’t until months later that I finally came to understand how the Korean notion of friendship is vastly different than that of the West. By their Confucian system of manners, “friendship ” is reserved for people of similar social standing— and to regard a teacher as a “friend ” ( rather than a superior ) would be a grave insult for both parties.
