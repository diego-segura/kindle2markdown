Nevertheless, as the man from the airport company put it to me over the telephone, with a lyricism as vague as it was beguiling, there were still many aspects of the world that perhaps only writers could be counted on to find the right words to express. A glossy marketing brochure, while in certain contexts a supremely effective instrument of communication, might not always convey the authenticity achievable by a single authorial voice– or, as my friend suggested with greater concision, could more easily be dismissed as ‘bullshit ’.

> The psychoanalyst Melanie Klein, in her Envy and Gratitude ( 1963 ), traced this latent sense of guilt back to an intrinsic part of human nature, originating in our Oedipal desire to murder our same- sex parent. So strong can the guilty feeling become in adulthood that it may provoke a compulsion to make false confessions to those in authority, or even to commit actual crimes as a means of gaining a measure of relief from an otherwise overwhelming impression of having done something wrong.
