<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 314</div><div class='noteText'>All doubts , however skeptical and cynical they may seem , are really a set of alternate beliefs . 9 You cannot doubt Belief A except from a position of faith in Belief B .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 323</div><div class='noteText'>Some will respond to all this , “ My doubts are not based on a leap of faith . I have no beliefs about God one way or another . I simply feel no need for God and I am not interested in thinking about it . ” But hidden beneath this feeling is the very modern American belief that the existence of God is a matter of indifference unless it intersects with my emotional needs . The speaker is betting his or her life that no God exists who would hold you accountable for your beliefs and behavior if you didn’t feel the need for him . That may be true or it may not be true , but , again , it is quite a leap of faith .</h3>

Each blind man could feel only part of the elephant — none could envision the entire elephant .

New Testament scholar Bill Lane writes : “ Jesus came to be with the Father for an interlude before his betrayal , but found hell rather than heaven opened before him , and he staggered . ” 8 On the cross , Jesus’s cry of dereliction — “ My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? ” — is a deeply relational statement . Lane writes : “ The cry has a ruthless authenticity … Jesus did not die renouncing God . Even in the inferno of abandonment he did not surrender his faith in God but expressed his anguished prayer in a cry of affirmation , ‘ My God , my God . ’ ” 9 Jesus still uses the language of intimacy — “ my God ” — even as he experiences infinite separation from the Father .</h3>
