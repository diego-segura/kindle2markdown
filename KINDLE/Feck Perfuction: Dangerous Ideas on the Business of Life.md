# Chapter 1. Voice
Location 206

> Chapter 1. Voice Your voice is who you are. Maybe not the “you ” you carry around every day, but the one yelling from inside, demanding to be heard. Your voice is the way you see the world and how you translate it back. When you train your voice and allow it to grow and be heard, that beautiful sound will carve a path for you to follow for life. Conversely, if you fail to use your voice, others will be in charge of it. And you. Never give in, never surrender. Your voice is your most powerful tool.

> Your purpose on this planet isn’t to become a millionaire, build a 401K, or even get a good job— your purpose is to figure out who or what you are. If you can do that, everything else is frosting. The great oracle herself, Dolly Parton, tells us, “Find out who you are and do it on purpose. ”

Location 314

> It comes by having faith in yourself, your ideas, and your abilities, and by saying, “I can do this. I belong here. ” By consistently leaning into your fears you create a new way of addressing them. You create a new habit. These habits change your reality. It’s not about “faking it ” or presenting a false exterior, but rather, through practice, creating a positive attitude of being. This practice becomes a habit, this habit becomes your life.

> Failure is a test. Its purpose is to weed out those of us who don’t want things badly enough. It presents a choice— you can stay down or you can get up and try again. Failure is a shepherd who’s smarter than you.

> 18. This is only a test

—

Location 463

> Everything about your life is a test. All things, both good and bad. They are a test of your character. They test whether you can accept challenges with grace and then grow because of them, or whether you choose to whine, curse the fates, and let your anger spill out, tainting everything and everyone around you.

> 28. Have a plan

—

Location 608

> A plan is your true North. It keeps you from wandering aimlessly through life. You now have a quest. It helps define what is and isn’t you. It gives you parameters of what you will and will not do, jobs you will or will not take. More than anything, your plan is a vision of who you can be and an acceptance of the idea that you are worthy of a beautiful and meaningful life.

Location 721

> “Multitasking ” merely means doing a number of things poorly. This is why we pay attention. Focus on one thing. Sometimes this approach is called “Do one thing and do it well. ” Read, study, and practice to become an expert on your subject.

> 38. Seek the muse

—

Location 756

> Complacency is the enemy, and settling down is settling. Our desire for an easier life gets us stuck in a smaller one, judging everything by the comfort and ease it brings, not by what it costs our soul. We willingly kill time “just chillin ’, ” while the muscles of our instinct and intuition grow flabby. We’ve got games, toys, and instant messaging but are spiritually and emotionally empty. We look around the internet and ogle others ’ creativity but put off developing our own. The search for meaning is replaced by shopping on the weekend. Even our food is calorie- rich but nutrient- weak.

Location 787

> So, we say yes when we mean no. The cost of all this yes is that we begin to lose ourselves. We slowly lose our personal time and even our self- respect. We end up angry and resentful of our job or loved ones, all because of one lousy habit of saying yes.

Once, while he was finishing up a large fuse box, his dad reached in and signed the inside of the box. “Why did you do that? ” David asked. “Artists sign their work, ” came the reply.

Location 869

> 48. Coffee notes My wife and I make love every morning— with coffee. Each morning, whichever of us prepares the coffee, or has the foresight to fix it the night before, also leaves the other a note. The notes are usually quick, collaged or drawn, or just a groggy sticky note. What it looks like is less important than what it says. Coffee notes are small reminders to not take our love for granted. They’re also a daily practice, getting better at making statements of devotion to an audience. Here it’s an audience of one.

Get me my red shirt! ” After a moment the second general, perplexed, asks, “General, why do you call for your red shirt? ” “If I am wounded in battle, my men will not see the blood and they will continue to follow me into the gunfire. ” The second general thinks on this for a moment and calls to his aide, “Get me my brown pants! ”

Location 931

> The secret of the universe is that no one knows shit. No one has the right answer, because no one has your answer. We want to know. We seek answers in books and seminars. We look for guidance from teachers, heroes, gurus, and even the internet. We’ve gotten so used to looking around that we’ve stopped looking inside.
