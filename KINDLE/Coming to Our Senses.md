> The first step on the adventure involved in coming to our senses on any and every level is the cultivation of a particular kind of awareness known as mindfulness. Mindfulness is the final common pathway of what makes us human, our capacity for awareness and for self- knowing. Mindfulness is cultivated by paying attention, and, as we shall see, this paying attention is developed and refined through a practice known as mindfulness meditation,

Puzzled looks. Then he would bang it straight down on the floor or on a table in front of him. It would make a loud thwack. “Do you hear this? ” Long silence. More puzzled looks.

> In our example of the neck pain, a mis- perception might take the form of an obsessive preoccupation with fleeting sensations in the neck that we might exaggerate into pain, making a mountain out of a molehill, so to speak, leading to hypochondriasis and maybe even wearing a neck brace unnecessarily, while not exercising the neck in ways that could make it stronger and more flexible. We might be walking around identifying with what we tell ourselves is a chronic neck problem, and missing all opportunities for looking more deeply into it. We could call this a form of unwise attention, rooted in a reactive self- preoccupation that keeps us stuck in disconnection of a different order.

Page 132 - Location 1914

> Both “medicine ” and “meditation ” come from the Latin mederi, which means to cure. However, the deep Indo- European root of mederi carries the core meaning of to measure. This is not our usual notion of measure as an accounting of the quantitative relationship to an established standard for a particular property such as length, volume, or area. Rather, it refers to the Platonic notion that all things have their own right inward measure, the properties or “isness ” that makes the object what it is. Medicine can be understood as that which restores right inward measure when it is disturbed, and meditation as the direct perception of right inward measure and the deep experiential knowing of its nature.

The third was the assertion, based on his experience as the experimenter in the laboratory of his own meditation practice, that cessation of dukkha is possible, in other words, that it is possible to be completely cured of the dis- ease caused by attachment and clinging. And the fourth Noble Truth outlines a systematic approach, known as the Noble Eightfold Path, to the cessation of dukkha, the dispelling of ignorance, and, thus, to liberation.

And would we know what to do with such time any longer, how to be in it, if it appeared? Or would we reflexively pick up a newspaper or phone someone, or start clicking the remote— as we ourselves get more and more remote from real life?

> This perspective stands in biology as a revered bulkhead against what used to be called vitalism, the belief that some special energy other than those explainable through physics, chemistry, biology, natural selection, and a huge amount of time, is required to give life its unique properties, and that would include sentience.

—

Page 324 - Location 4563

> How we understand our inherited sentience and what we do with it individually and collectively as a species is clearly the defining issue of our time. The impersonal nature of the biological view of living systems is worth emphasizing, because it says very clearly that there is no intrinsically mystical dimension to the unfolding of life.

Page 328 - Location 4624

> If we can learn to question the ways in which a sense of a self solidifies around occurrences and appearances and then defends itself at all costs, if we choose to question whether the sense of self is fundamentally real or just a construct of mind, to examine whether it is invariant or continually changing, and to ponder even how important its views are in any moment in relationship to the larger whole, then we might not be so self- preoccupied and consumed so much of the time with our thoughts and opinions and with our personal stories of gain and loss, and so strongly oriented toward maximizing the former and minimizing the latter. We might see through this veil of our own creation that subtly or not so subtly colors every aspect of experience. We might hear ourselves more accurately. We might take ourselves less seriously, and we might take less seriously the stories we concoct about how things should be for me to be happy or to get “my way. ”

> How often do we voluntarily but unwittingly banish ourselves from ourselves, abdicate our wholeness, and subjugate our consciousness, our sentience and our common sense, our very sovereignty and the possibilities of true healing, in the hope of achieving invulnerability, to protect ourselves from more hurt, to lessen our pain?

—

Page 338 - Location 4763

> A human being is a part of the whole, called by us “Universe, ” a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest— a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation, and a foundation for inner security.

> The loss of this basic orienting function is chillingly evoked in the opening scene of Alan Lightman’s novel The Diagnosis, in which, somewhere between suburban Alewife station and his destination in downtown Boston, a businessman commuter simply and inexplicably forgets who he is and where he is going. The surreal nightmare of losing one’s purpose and orientation ( “Where am I going this morning, all dressed up for work? Oh yes. To the office, course, like all these other people on the train. But where do I work, and what is it that actually I do? ” ) leads all of a sudden to immersion in a dreamlike state in which everything is vaguely familiar and yet not. It rapidly turns into a living nightmare.

—

Page 345 - Location 4875

> But “Who am I? ” and “Where am I going? ” are deep questions, Zen koansφ really, and the suggestion is that we would benefit deeply from asking them of ourselves on a regular basis, as a meditation practice, rather than simply taking who we are and what we do for granted, especially if we think we know and are not so inclined to ask such questions and peel back the film of appearance and the stories we tell ourselves that may be covering the deep structure and multiple dimensions and textures of our actual lives. For none of us ever know how long we can count on having these capacities at our disposal, or how long we actually have to continue living and learning and growing into the fullness of ourselves.

Page 350 - Location 4944

> Just by asking, for instance, “Who is suffering? ” “Who doesn’t want what is happening to be happening? ” “Who is frightened? ” “Who is thinking? ” “Who is feeling insecure, or unwanted, or lost? ” or “What am I? ” we are initiating nothing less than a rotation in consciousness into another “dimension, ” orthogonal to conventional reality, and thus, able to pertain at the same time as the more conventional one because you have simply “added more space. ” Nothing needs to change. It’s just that your world immediately becomes a lot bigger, and more real. Everything old looks different because it is now being seen in a new light— an awareness that is no longer confined by the conventional dimensionality and mind set.

—

Page 350 - Location 4953

> When you have an experience of rotating in consciousness so that your world does all of a sudden feel bigger and more real, you are catching a glimpse of what Buddhists refer to as absolute or ultimate reality, a dimensionality that is beyond conditioning but that is capable of recognizing conditioning as it arises. It is awareness itself, the knowing capacity of mind itself, beyond a knower and what is known, just knowing.

> We are not strangers to orthogonal shifts. An authentic apology, for instance, as Aaron Lazare deftly demonstrates with numerous examples in his book On Apology, can instantly dissolve long- standing rancor, resentment, humiliation, guilt, and shame in both parties, and lead to almost instantaneous healing, forgiveness, expressions of love, and caring, among both individual people, and even between nations

> To my mind, an orthogonal institution would be one that had rotated in consciousness to some degree and could thus exist, as noted in the last chapter, in the same space, but with a larger dimensionality, and at the same time as more conventional elements of the institution, or exist on its own within the larger conventional reality.

> When tested, these lamas showed very large left to right ratios at baseline, and even more remarkably, in some cases enormous shifts to greater left activation while practicing different forms of meditation. Interestingly, the overall brain patterning seen in the lamas was in the same direction and in the same regions of the frontal cortex as the shifts we were observing in our study, although in the case of the lamas, it was quantitatively far stronger. The comparison suggests that regular people beginning meditation— and not just adepts who have undergone years and years of intensive training and practice— in a fairly short period of time, can show changes in the brain and in the body similar to those with far greater training and practice experience, changes that are consistent with a refining of one’s capacity for paying attention and for residing in greater empathic awareness.

Stress is caused by being “here ” but wanting to be “there, ” or being in the present but wanting to be in the future. It’s a split that tears you apart inside.

The morning after Election Day, the retreatants were given the option of lifting up a piece of blank paper on the bulletin board that shielded the result from sight, so that only those who really wanted to know would be able to see who had been elected president. The rest could find out when the retreat was over. That retreat went until mid- December. Under the piece of paper, day after day, the message was always the same inconceivable one: “We don’t know yet. ” Imagine how confused the meditators were who wanted to know and knew only that nobody did, without any of the story of why! A perfect example of truth trumping fiction.
