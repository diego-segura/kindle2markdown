> Blaise Pascal was born in 1623, and was recognized from an early age— and by more than just his proud family— to be a genius. By twelve, he had worked out the first thirty- two propositions of Euclid; he went on to invent the mathematics of probability; he measured atmospheric pressure, constructed a calculating machine, designed an omnibus, got tuberculosis, and wrote the brilliant and pessimistic series of aphorisms in defense of Christian belief known as the Pensées.

> The lesson? To hang on to the performance, to read the newspaper as though it were only the tip of a tragic or comic novel, and to use thirty pages to describe a fall into sleep when need be. And if there is no time, at least to resist the approach of Alfred Humblot at Ollendorf and Jacques Madeleine at Fasquelle, which Proust defined as “the self- satisfaction felt by ‘busy ’ men— however idiotic their business— at ‘not having time ’ to do what you are doing. ”

> However, an area in which Robert appeared to trail his brother was in the ability to notice things. Robert did not show much reaction when there was a window open on a pollen- rich day or five tons of coal had run over him; he could have traveled from Everest to Jericho and taken little note of an altitude change, or slept on five tins of peas without suspecting that there was anything unusual under the mattress.

> Indeed, if a genuine priority is the development of our mental capacities, the implication is that we would be better off being unhappy than content, better off pursuing tormented love affairs than reading Plato or Spinoza.

—

Page 69 - Location 768

> This may explain Proust’s suspicion of doctors. Doctors are in an awkward position according to the Proustian theory of knowledge, for they are people who profess to understand the workings of the body, even though their knowledge has not primarily emerged from any pain in their own body. They have merely attended years of medical school.

—

Page 71 - Location 796

> It seems that such knowledge has usually been the privileged preserve of, and the only blessing granted to, the violently miserable. Nevertheless, before subscribing uncritically to a Romantic cult of suffering, it should be added that suffering has, on its own, never been quite enough.

Page 87 - Location 988

> We feel something, and reach out for the nearest phrase or hum with which to communicate, but which fails to do justice to what has induced us to do so. We hear Beethoven’s Ninth and hum poum, poum, poum; we see the pyramids at Giza and go, “That’s nice. ” These sounds are asked to account for an experience, but their poverty prevents either ourselves or our interlocutors from really understanding what we have lived through.

> Sometimes in the afternoon sky, a white moon would creep up like a little cloud, furtive, without display, suggesting an actress who does not have to “come on ” for a while, and so goes “in front ” in her ordinary clothes to watch the rest of the company for a moment, but keeps in the background, not wishing to attract attention to herself

Page 92 - Location 1045

> “Why, when one says ‘1871 ’, add ‘that most abominable of all years. ’ Why is Paris immediately dubbed ‘the great city ’ and Delaunay ‘the master painter ’? Why must emotion inevitably be ‘discreet ’ and goodnaturedness ‘smiling ’ and bereavements ‘cruel ’, and countless other fine phrases that I can’t remember? ”

—

Page 92 - Location 1049

> These phrases were of course anything but fine, they were a caricature of fineness.

Page 94 - Location 1063

> Every writer is obliged to create his own language, as every violinist is obliged to create his own “tone ” …. I don’t mean to say that I like original writers who write badly. I prefer— and perhaps it’s a weakness— those who write well. But they begin to write well only on condition that they’re original, that they create their own language. Correctness, perfection of style do exist, but on the other side of originality, after having gone through all the faults, not this side. Correctness this side— “discreet emotion, ” “smiling good nature, ” “most abominable of all years ”— doesn’t exist. The only way to defend language is to attack it, yes, yes, Madame Straus!

Page 95 - Location 1084

> Trying to sound like Chateaubriand or Victor Hugo when you are in fact the literary editor of La Revue de Paris implies a singular lack of concern with capturing what is distinctive about being Louis Ganderax, much as attempting to sound like the archetypal bourgeois Parisian young woman ( “I don’t have money to burn ”; “You really are the limit! ” ), when you are in fact a particular young woman called Albertine,

> an unenviable power of divination, he discovered all the pettiness, often hidden, of the human heart, and it horrified him: the most insignificant lies, the mental reservations, the secrecies, the fake disinterestedness, the kind word which has an ulterior motive, the truth which has been slightly deformed for convenience, in short, all the things which worry us in love, sadden us in friendship and make our dealings with others banal were for Proust a subject of constant surprise, sadness or irony.

> His psychological insight, so great that it had threatened to put a palm reader out of her job, could be wholly directed toward identifying the appropriate word, smile, or flower to win others over. And it worked. He excelled at the art of making friends, he acquired an enormous number, they loved his company, were devoted to him,

# 8. How to Be Happy in Love
Page 163 - Location 1830

> Noah was six hundred years old when God flooded the world, and would have had much time to look at his surroundings, the fact that they were always there, that they were so permanent in his visual field, would not have encouraged him to re- create them internally.

—

Page 165 - Location 1848

> There is no doubt that a person’s charms are less frequently a cause of love than a remark such as: “No, this evening I shan’t be free. ” If this response proves bewitching, it is because of the connection made in Noah’s case between appreciation and absence. Though a person may be filled with attributes, an incentive is nevertheless required to ensure that a seducer will focus wholeheartedly on these, an incentive which finds perfect form in a dinner rebuff— the dating equivalent of forty days at sea.

—

Page 168 - Location 1883

> The prostitute is in an unfortunate position in the Proustian theory of desire, because she both wishes to entice a man and yet is commercially prevented from doing what is most likely to encourage love— namely, tell him that she is not free tonight.

> The moral? That there is no greater homage we could pay to Proust than to pass the same verdict on him as he passed on Ruskin— namely, that for all its qualities, his work must eventually also prove silly, maniacal, constraining, false and ridiculous to those who spend too long on it.
