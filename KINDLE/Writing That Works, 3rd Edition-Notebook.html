<h2 class='sectionHeading'>&amp;#x00A0;&amp;#x00A0;1- Writing That Works</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 1 &middot; Location 70</div><div class='noteText'>“Too many of the communications I get are meaningless,” observes a leading CEO. “They don’t help me understand what action the writer wants me to take. They waste my time.”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 2 &middot; Location 91</div><div class='noteText'>putting down first what you want the reader to do, next the three most important things the reader needs to understand to take that action, then starting to write. When you’re done, he suggests asking yourself whether if you were the reader, would you take action on the basis of what is written.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 6 &middot; Location 139</div><div class='noteText'>Consider a “maturing file” for knotty problems. Many disappear if given time. Others call for more thought.</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>&amp;#x00A0;&amp;#x00A0;2- Don&amp;#x2019;t Mumble - and Other Principles of Effective Writing</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 8 &middot; Location 161</div><div class='noteText'>It is generally desirable to communicate your thoughts in a forthright manner.     Don’t mumble. Toning your point down and tiptoeing around it may, in many circumstances, tempt the reader to tune out and allow his mind to wander.    </h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 8 &middot; Location 169</div><div class='noteText'>When you write anything longer than a few paragraphs, start by telling the reader where you are going. The committee proposes that the company invest $1 million in a library. First you must know where you are going yourself. Make an outline of your major points, placing supporting details in their proper position. Then, in your paper, use your outline to signal the major points for your reader. Underline and number each important section heading. This serves the same purpose as chapter titles in a book. End with a summary. And keep in mind that a summary is not a conclusion. Your summary should introduce no new ideas; it should summarize, as briefly as possible, the most important points you have made. If your paper comes to a conclusion — the point of your case — your summary should summarize that too, to fix the essentials of your message in your reader’s mind. Summary: Make an outline; use your outline to help your reader; number and underline section headings; summarize.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 9 &middot; Location 179</div><div class='noteText'>Note: Some lengthy documents start with a summary, often called “Executive Summary.” The same principles apply.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 9 &middot; Location 185</div><div class='noteText'>It all began to crumble the afternoon Mom’s Best Cookies, Inc., fired Mom. The cult of James Dean was fostered by his early death, and it didn’t hurt his hometown any. It’s official — Wall Street is declaring war on sexism. By contrast, here is an example of the kind of mumbling first sentence that confronts people in their office reading: This provides the Argus, Mitchell &amp; Dohn perspective on a consumers'-eye view of the current position and growth potential of Blake’s Tea and Jones’s Tea, the major entries of National Beverages in the English tea market.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 13 &middot; Location 245</div><div class='noteText'>State your meaning precisely: Vague     Precise Very overspent     Overspent by $10,000 Slightly behind schedule     One day late</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 14 &middot; Location 261</div><div class='noteText'>Choose adjectives and adverbs that make your meaning more precise. Do not use them as mere exclamation points.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 17 &middot; Location 301</div><div class='noteText'>It is believed that with the parameters that have been imposed by your management, a viable program may be hard to evolve. Net net: If our program is to impact the consumer to the optimum, meaningful interface with your management may be necessitated.    </h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 17 &middot; Location 303</div><div class='noteText'>We believe that the limits your management set may rule out an effective program. If we expect to reach our goal, we’d better ask your management to listen to our case.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 21 &middot; Location 325</div><div class='noteText'>i.e. (id est) means “that is”: He preferred short names; i.e., nothing longer than four letters.     e.g. (exempli gratia) means “for example”: He gave all his products short names; e.g., Hit, Miss, Duck, Dive.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 21 &middot; Location 343</div><div class='noteText'>Fortuitous means happening by chance, accidental. Being seated next to his ex-wife was fortuitous — but hardly fortunate.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 21 &middot; Location 358</div><div class='noteText'>Notorious means famous in an unsavory way: Jack the Ripper was perhaps the most notorious criminal of the nineteenth century.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 23 &middot; Location 378</div><div class='noteText'>There are only 266 words in the Gettysburg Address.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 24 &middot; Location 403</div><div class='noteText'>The song goes, “Softly, as in a morning sunrise” — and Ring Lardner explained that this was as opposed to a late afternoon or evening sunrise.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 29 &middot; Location 479</div><div class='noteText'>When the head of a large company put quotation marks around a word in an important paper, his administrative assistant asked him why he did that. He replied that it was to stress the truth of the point. The assistant asked whether it would stress the truth if he were to register at a hotel as John Durgin and “wife.”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 30 &middot; Location 490</div><div class='noteText'>An obituary writer held in his file an envelope to be opened only when H. L. Mencken died. The message, from the famous writer himself: “Don’t overdo it.”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 30 &middot; Location 497</div><div class='noteText'>involvement. Ambiguity often results from a single sentence carrying too much cargo. Breaking up your sentences can work wonders. Here is a statement from a report by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission: It would be prudent to consider expeditiously the provision of instrumentation that would provide an unambiguous indication of the level of fluid in the reactor vessel. If you break that idea into two sentences, and follow other suggestions in this chapter, you might end up with something like this: We should make up our minds quickly about getting better gauges. Good gauges would tell us exactly how much fluid is in the reactor vessel.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 33 &middot; Location 534</div><div class='noteText'>Consider the surprising bestselling business book Who Moved My Cheese? — an allegory about change by Spencer Johnson. It’s a simple, almost corny, story about two small mice and two small humans who live in a maze where they find cheese, and how they respond when one day their cheese isn’t where it used to be. Its appeal, says Fortune, is both its message — prepare for change, accept it, enjoy it — and its telling, in simple language.</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>&amp;#x00A0;&amp;#x00A0;3- &amp;#x201C;I Love My Computer&amp;#x201D;</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 41 &middot; Location 638</div><div class='noteText'>Stick to the point. In the cartoon strip Shoe, a character sitting in front of his PC replies to an onlooker who has asked what he’s writing: “Nothing so far. But the computer makes writing a lot easier, I’ll say that. With just a flick of the finger I can write reams of nothing. I call it streams of unconsciousness.”</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>&amp;#x00A0;&amp;#x00A0;4- E-mail &amp;#x2014; the Great Mailbox in the Sky</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 51 &middot; Location 777</div><div class='noteText'>Someone asked Rodin how he could sculpt an elephant out of marble. It’s easy, he responded, “You just chip away everything that isn’t an elephant.” Chip away everything that isn’t your point.</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>&amp;#x00A0;&amp;#x00A0;5- Memos and Letters That Get Things Done</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 68 &middot; Location 1009</div><div class='noteText'>Since it goes without saying that you hope you’ve answered them, go without saying</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 70 &middot; Location 1029</div><div class='noteText'>An Italian proverb says: “Think much, speak little, write less.”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 78 &middot; Location 1146</div><div class='noteText'>That’s the correct order for letters of inquiry; first, what you want; second, who you are and why you want it; third, an expression of appreciation for favors to come.</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>&amp;#x00A0;&amp;#x00A0;6- Writing for an Audience: Presentations and Speeches</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 100 &middot; Location 1471</div><div class='noteText'>David Ogilvy was famous for adding drama to his presentations. To make his point about the importance of hiring the best people, he presented his directors sets of Russian dolls — those nesting dolls that come apart to reveal successively smaller dolls inside. Around the smallest doll was a slip of paper with this message: If we hire people who are smaller than we are, we shall become a company of dwarfs. If we hire people who are bigger than we are, we shall become a company of giants.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 105 &middot; Location 1538</div><div class='noteText'>2. Start fast</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>&amp;#x00A0;&amp;#x00A0;7- Plans and Reports That Make Things Happen</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 111 &middot; Location 1610</div><div class='noteText'>The best report ever written may have been Julius Caesar’s Veni, vidi, vici. “I came, I saw, I conquered.”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 114 &middot; Location 1662</div><div class='noteText'>A plan is a recommendation until it is approved. Then it becomes a commitment to action. So it must describe, step by step, exactly what is to be done.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 117 &middot; Location 1714</div><div class='noteText'>“The horror of that moment,” the King went on, “I shall never, never forget!” “You will, though,” the Queen said, “if you don’t make a memorandum of it.” —ALICE’S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>&amp;#x00A0;&amp;#x00A0;8- Recommendations and Proposals That Sell Ideas</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 130 &middot; Location 1892</div><div class='noteText'>In such cases, reframe the question. The question Ogilvy &amp; Mather anticipated was “Does anybody read long copy?” The recommendation reframed it so that the reply would reveal what the questioner actually needed to know: “Does long copy sell?”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 132 &middot; Location 1930</div><div class='noteText'>Many of the changes from draft to draft of this book resulted from a struggle to connect examples precisely to the points they illustrate. We had to force ourselves to throw out a lot of good writing that was not quite relevant.</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>&amp;#x00A0;&amp;#x00A0;9- Asking for Money: Sales and Fund-Raising Letters</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 139 &middot; Location 2028</div><div class='noteText'>The professional direct mail writer works first on the coupon, not the letter. What is the offer? How should it be stated? What are the terms?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 142 &middot; Location 2072</div><div class='noteText'>The essence of a successful strategy is sacrifice; play down lesser benefits to concentrate on the one with the most sales power.</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>10- Coping with Political Correctness</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 151 &middot; Location 2186</div><div class='noteText'>As a country song puts it, “sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can break my heart.”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 151 &middot; Location 2187</div><div class='noteText'>Bernard Shaw defined a gentleman as somebody who “never insults a person unintentionally.”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 155 &middot; Location 2248</div><div class='noteText'>“Every novelist hopes they’ll win” grates on many ears as badly as would “Every novelist hope he’ll win.” Fortunately there is a simple way to be correct both grammatically and politically. Just put the point into the plural: “All novelists hope they will win the Pulitzer Prize.”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 155 &middot; Location 2251</div><div class='noteText'>Another trick of the trade is to switch from the third person to the second person: instead of “when an employee receives a message addressed to him or her,” write “when you receive a message addressed to you.”</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>11- Writing a Resume &amp;#x2014; and Getting an Interview</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 164 &middot; Location 2376</div><div class='noteText'>A better letter — starting with the needs of the reader rather than the virtues of the writer — began by stating: According to press reports, your agency is under enormous pressure in staff and budgets, and it is obvious that you must have people who can move fast and carry a heavy load. Here are several reasons why my background should be helpful to EPA in exactly those ways.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 169 &middot; Location 2451</div><div class='noteText'>7. Propose a specific next step</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>12- Editing Yourself</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 181 &middot; Location 2610</div><div class='noteText'>Let time elapse between drafts. Solicit the opinion of other people.</h3>
