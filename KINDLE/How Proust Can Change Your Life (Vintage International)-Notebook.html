<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 69 &middot; Location 768</div><div class='noteText'>This may explain Proust’s suspicion of doctors . Doctors are in an awkward position according to the Proustian theory of knowledge , for they are people who profess to understand the workings of the body , even though their knowledge has not primarily emerged from any pain in their own body . They have merely attended years of medical school .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 71 &middot; Location 796</div><div class='noteText'>It seems that such knowledge has usually been the privileged preserve of , and the only blessing granted to , the violently miserable .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 87 &middot; Location 988</div><div class='noteText'>We feel something , and reach out for the nearest phrase or hum with which to communicate , but which fails to do justice to what has induced us to do so . We hear Beethoven’s Ninth and hum poum , poum , poum ; we see the pyramids at Giza and go , “ That’s nice . ” These sounds are asked to account for an experience , but their poverty prevents either ourselves or our interlocutors from really understanding what we have lived through .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 92 &middot; Location 1045</div><div class='noteText'>“ Why , when one says ‘ 1871 ’ , add ‘ that most abominable of all years . ’ Why is Paris immediately dubbed ‘ the great city ’ and Delaunay ‘ the master painter ’ ? Why must emotion inevitably be ‘ discreet ’ and goodnaturedness ‘ smiling ’ and bereavements ‘ cruel ’ , and countless other fine phrases that I can’t remember ? ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 92 &middot; Location 1049</div><div class='noteText'>These phrases were of course anything but fine , they were a caricature of fineness .</h3>

I don’t mean to say that I like original writers who write badly . I prefer — and perhaps it’s a weakness — those who write well . But they begin to write well only on condition that they’re original , that they create their own language . Correctness , perfection of style do exist , but on the other side of originality , after having gone through all the faults , not this side . Correctness this side — “ discreet emotion , ” “ smiling good nature , ” “ most abominable of all years ” — doesn’t exist . The only way to defend language is to attack it , yes , yes , Madame Straus !</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 95 &middot; Location 1084</div><div class='noteText'>Trying to sound like Chateaubriand or Victor Hugo when you are in fact the literary editor of La Revue de Paris implies a singular lack of concern with capturing what is distinctive about being Louis Ganderax , much as attempting to sound like the archetypal bourgeois Parisian young woman ( “ I don’t have money to burn ” ; “ You really are the limit ! ” ) , when you are in fact a particular young woman called Albertine ,</h3>
