No Escape, No Problem</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 6 &middot; Location 207</div><div class='noteText'>The basic notion of lojong is that we can make friends with what we reject , what we see as “ bad ” in ourselves and in other people .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 7 &middot; Location 219</div><div class='noteText'>The lojong teachings encourage us , if we enjoy what we are experiencing , to think of other people and wish for them to feel that .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 19 &middot; Location 377</div><div class='noteText'>“ Self - liberate even the antidote</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 19 &middot; Location 385</div><div class='noteText'>Affirmations are like screaming that you’re okay in order to overcome this whisper that you’re not . That’s a big contrast to actually uncovering the whisper , realizing that it’s passing memory , and moving closer to all those fears and all those edgy feelings that maybe you’re not okay . Well , no big deal . None of us is okay and all of us are fine . It’s not just one way .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 20 &middot; Location 400</div><div class='noteText'>When something pleasant comes up , instead of rushing around the room like a windup toy , you could just pause and notice , and let go .</h3>

<h2 class='sectionHeading'>4. Let the World Speak for Itself</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 22 &middot; Location 415</div><div class='noteText'>“ In postmeditation , be a child of illusion . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 24 &middot; Location 453</div><div class='noteText'>Being a child of illusion also has to do with beginning to encourage yourself not to be a walking battleground . We have such strong feelings of good and evil , right and wrong . We also feel that parts of ourselves are bad or evil and parts of ourselves are good and wholesome . All these pairs of opposites — happy and sad , victory and defeat , loss and gain — are at war with each other . The truth is that good and bad coexist ; sour and sweet coexist . They aren’t really opposed to each other . We could start to open our eyes and our hearts to that deep way of perceiving , like moving into a whole new dimension of experience : becoming a child of illusion .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 27 &middot; Location 502</div><div class='noteText'>When Ishi was first taken to San Francisco , he went to the Oroville train station and stood on the platform . When the train came in , without anyone really noticing , he simply walked away very quietly and stood behind a pillar . Then the others noticed and beckoned to him , and they all got on the train to San Francisco . Later , Ishi told Kroeber that for his whole life when he and the other members of his tribe had seen that train they had thought it was a demon that ate people , because of how it snaked along and bellowed smoke and fire . When Kroeber heard that , he was awestruck . He asked , “ How did you have the courage to just get on the train if you thought it was a demon ? ” Then Ishi said , quite simply , “ Well , my life has taught me to be more curious than afraid . ” His life had taught him what it meant to be a child of illusion .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>5. Poison as Medicine</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 28 &middot; Location 510</div><div class='noteText'>“ Three objects , three poisons , and three seeds of virtue ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 30 &middot; Location 539</div><div class='noteText'>The three poisons are always trapping you in one way or another , imprisoning you and making your world really small . When you feel craving , you could be sitting on the edge of the Grand Canyon , but all you can see is this piece of chocolate cake that you’re craving . With aversion , you’re sitting on the edge of the Grand Canyon , and all you can hear is the angry words you said to someone ten years ago . With ignorance , you’re sitting on the edge of the Grand Canyon with a paper bag over your head . Each of the three poisons has the power to capture you so completely that you don’t even perceive what’s in front of you .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 31 &middot; Location 570</div><div class='noteText'>What we’re working with in our basic shamatha - vipashyana practice — and explicitly with the tonglen practice — is the middle ground between acting out and repressing . We’re discovering how to hold our seat and feel completely what’s underneath all that story line of wanting , not wanting , and so forth .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>6. Start Where You Are</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 35 &middot; Location 620</div><div class='noteText'>That light touch of acknowledging what we’re thinking and letting it go is the key to connecting with this wealth that we have .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 36 &middot; Location 633</div><div class='noteText'>At that point , all of them left except one . Milarepa said , “ Oh , this one is particularly vicious . ” ( We all know that one . Sometimes we have lots of them like that . Sometimes we feel that’s all we’ve got . ) He didn’t know what to do , so he surrendered himself even further . He walked over and put himself right into the mouth of the demon and said , “ Just eat me up if you want to . ” Then that demon left too . The moral of the story is , when the resistance is gone , so are the demons .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 38 &middot; Location 666</div><div class='noteText'>The first stage is flashing openness , or flashing absolute bodhichitta . The slogan “ Rest in the nature of alaya , the essence ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 38 &middot; Location 668</div><div class='noteText'>The second stage is working with the texture . You visualize breathing in dark , heavy , and hot and breathing out white , light , and cool .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 39 &middot; Location 678</div><div class='noteText'>The third stage is working with a specific heartfelt object of suffering . You breathe in the pain of a specific person or animal that you wish to help .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 39 &middot; Location 682</div><div class='noteText'>The fourth stage extends this wish to relieve suffering much further . You start with the homeless person and then extend out to all those who are suffering just as she is , or to all those who are suicidal like your uncle or to all those who are feeling the jealousy or addiction</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 41 &middot; Location 718</div><div class='noteText'>At that point , simultaneously , it is no longer your own particular burden ; it is just the rage of sentient beings , which includes you . You breathe that in , and you breathe out a sense of ventilation , so that all sentient beings could experience that .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 41 &middot; Location 720</div><div class='noteText'>Example</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 43 &middot; Location 747</div><div class='noteText'>Flashing openness Working with the texture , breathing in dark , heavy , and hot and breathing out white , light , and cool Working with relieving a specific , heartfelt instance of suffering Extending that wish to help everyone</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>7. Bringing All That We Meet to the Path</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 44 &middot; Location 754</div><div class='noteText'>“ When the world is filled with evil , / Transform all mishaps into the path of bodhi . ” The word bodhi means “ enlightenment . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 45 &middot; Location 770</div><div class='noteText'>This is tricky business . What’s the difference between seeing that harm has been done and blaming ? Perhaps it is that rather than point the finger of blame , we raise questions : “ How can I communicate ? How can I help the harm that has been done unravel itself ? How can I help others find their own wisdom , kindness , and sense of humor ? ” That’s a much greater challenge than blaming and hating and acting out .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 48 &middot; Location 816</div><div class='noteText'>Now you begin to relate with those feelings . You develop some compassion , connecting with the soft spot . You relate with what begins to happen when you’re not protecting yourself so much . Then gradually , like Ishi , you become more curious than afraid . To be fearless isn’t really to overcome fear , it’s to come to know its nature .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>8. Drive All Blames into One</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 54 &middot; Location 917</div><div class='noteText'>“ That guy , he’s not afraid to be a fool . ”</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>9. Be Grateful to Everyone</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 56 &middot; Location 926</div><div class='noteText'>“ Be grateful to everyone ” is about making peace with the aspects of ourselves that we have rejected .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 59 &middot; Location 977</div><div class='noteText'>“ You should never have expectations for other people . Just be kind to them , ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 61 &middot; Location 1004</div><div class='noteText'>These are the people who , when your habitual style is working just fine and everyone’s agreeing with you , say , “ No way am I going to go along with what you just asked me to do . I think it’s stupid . ” You think , “ What do I do now ? ” And usually what you do is to get everybody else on your team . You sit around and talk about what a creep this person is who confronted you .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>10. Cutting the Solidity of Thoughts</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 64 &middot; Location 1050</div><div class='noteText'>“ Seeing confusion as the four kayas / Is unsurpassable shunyata protection</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>11. Overcoming Resistance</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 70 &middot; Location 1129</div><div class='noteText'>“ Four practices are the best of methods . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 70 &middot; Location 1130</div><div class='noteText'>( 1 ) accumulating merit , ( 2 ) purifying our negative actions — usually called confessing our negative actions , ( 3 ) feeding the ghosts , and ( 4 ) offering to the protectors ,</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 75 &middot; Location 1219</div><div class='noteText'>This sudden unreasonableness that comes out of nowhere is called a dön . It wakes you up , and you should regard that as best , rather than try to get rid of the problem . So , on the outer level , you give the dön a cake . On the inner level , you see that a dön has risen , that it has all this force , but you refrain from blackening anybody’s eyes , from acting it out , and you also refrain from repressing it . You take the middle way yet again and let yourself be there with the full force of the dön . Being there has the power to purify you . That’s a description of 100 percent mindfulness</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 76 &middot; Location 1226</div><div class='noteText'>“ Not only do I not want you to go away , you can come back any time you like . And here , have some cake . ”</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>12. Empty Boat</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 78 &middot; Location 1257</div><div class='noteText'>real - life problems are the material for waking up , not the reason to stop trying .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 78 &middot; Location 1258</div><div class='noteText'>Today’s slogan is “ Whatever you meet unexpectedly , join with meditation . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 81 &middot; Location 1299</div><div class='noteText'>There’s a Zen story in which a man is enjoying himself on a river at dusk . He sees another boat coming down the river toward him . At first it seems so nice to him that someone else is also enjoying the river on a nice summer evening . Then he realizes that the boat is coming right toward him , faster and faster . He begins to get upset and starts to yell , “ Hey , hey , watch out ! For Pete’s sake , turn aside ! ” But the boat just comes faster and faster , right toward him . By this time he’s standing up in his boat , screaming and shaking his fist , and then the boat smashes right into him . He sees that it’s an empty boat . This is the classic story of our whole life situation . There are a lot of empty boats out there that we’re always screaming at and shaking our fists at . Instead , we could let them stop our minds . Even if they only stop our mind for one point one seconds , we can rest in that little gap . When the story line starts , we can do the tonglen practice of exchanging ourselves for others . In this way everything we meet has the potential to help us cultivate compassion and reconnect with the spacious , open quality of our minds .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>13. Teachings for Life and Death</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 84 &middot; Location 1344</div><div class='noteText'>The Native Americans , before they went into battle , would say , “ Today is a good day to die . ” You could also say , “ Today is a good day to live . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 86 &middot; Location 1375</div><div class='noteText'>I was having anxiety attacks , and he said that I should teach the dharma to myself , just good simple dharma . So now I say , “ Pema , what do you really want ? Do you want to shut down and close off , do you want to stay imprisoned ? Or do you want to let yourself relax here , let yourself die ? Here’s your chance to actually realize something . Here’s your chance not to be stuck . So what do you really want ? Do you want always to be right or do you want to wake up ? ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 87 &middot; Location 1391</div><div class='noteText'>Aspiration is much like prayer , except that there’s nobody who hears you .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 87 &middot; Location 1393</div><div class='noteText'>The five strengths are the heart instructions on how to live and how to die .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>14. Loving-Kindness and Compassion</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 91 &middot; Location 1441</div><div class='noteText'>I saw a cartoon that describes this . A head of iceberg lettuce is sitting in a garden saying , “ Oh , no , how did I get in this vegetable garden again ? I wanted to be a wildflower ! ” The caption reads , “ Oscar is born again as a head of iceberg lettuce in order to overcome his fear of being eaten . ” One can think from a bigger perspective than this whole notion of reward and punishment . You could see your life as an adult education course . Some of the curriculum you like and some you don’t like ; some of what comes up you find workable , some you don’t . That’s the curriculum for attaining enlightenment . The question is , how do you work with it ?</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>15. Lighten Up</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 92 &middot; Location 1457</div><div class='noteText'>“ Always maintain only a joyful mind ” and “ If you can practice even when distracted , you are well trained ”</h3>

<h2 class='sectionHeading'>16. Abandon Any Hope of Fruition</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 96 &middot; Location 1519</div><div class='noteText'>“ Abandon any hope of fruition . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 99 &middot; Location 1572</div><div class='noteText'>This teaching was powerful for me ; it stuck . I would find myself in various states of mind and various moods , going up and down , going left and right , falling on my face and sitting up — just in all these different life situations — and I would remember , “ Buddha falling flat on her face ; buddha feeling on top of the world ; buddha longing for yesterday . ” I began to learn that I couldn’t get away from buddha no matter how hard I tried . I could stick with myself through thick and thin . If one would enter into an unconditional relationship with oneself , one would be entering into an unconditional relationship with buddha .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 99 &middot; Location 1580</div><div class='noteText'>Because it’s a monastery , there’s nothing you can do at Gampo Abbey that’s fun , unless you like to meditate all the time or take walks in nature , but everything gets boring after awhile .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 100 &middot; Location 1583</div><div class='noteText'>The reason it’s uncomfortable is that you can’t get away from yourself there . However , the more people make friends with themselves , the more they find it a nurturing and supportive place where you can find out the buddhaness of your own self as you are right now , today . Right now today , could you make an unconditional relationship with yourself ? Just at the height you are , the weight you are , the amount of intelligence that you have , the burden of pain that you have ? Could you enter into an unconditional relationship with that ?</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>17. Compassionate Action</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 102 &middot; Location 1612</div><div class='noteText'>But on that day when I had spent so much energy composing this letter , just by a turn of circumstance , something happened to me that caused me to feel tremendous loneliness . I felt sad and vulnerable . In that state of mind , I suddenly knew where my friend’s letter had come from — loneliness and feeling left out . It was her attempt to communicate</h3>

The Big Squeeze</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 124 &middot; Location 1944</div><div class='noteText'>But if we wish to communicate , if we really wish to open our hearts , sooner or later we are going to find ourselves in the big squeeze , where we can’t buy it and we can’t throw it out , and we are caught in the juicy situation of being big and small at the same time .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 125 &middot; Location 1962</div><div class='noteText'>A hermit well known for his austerity had been practicing in a cave for twenty years . An unconventional teacher named Patrul Rinpoche showed up at the cave , and the hermit humbly and sweetly welcomed him in . Patrul Rinpoche said , “ Tell me , what have you been doing here ? ” “ I’ve been practicing the perfection of patience , ” the hermit answered . Putting his face very close to the hermit’s face , Patrul Rinpoche said , “ But a pair of old scoundrels like us , we don’t care anything about patience really . We only do this to get everyone’s admiration , right ? We just do this to get people to think we are big shots , don’t we ? ” And the hermit started getting irritated . But Patrul Rinpoche wouldn’t stop . He just kept laughing and patting him on the back and saying , “ Yeah , we sure know how to dupe people , don’t we ? We really know . I’ll bet they bring you a lot of gifts , don’t they ? ” At this point the hermit stood up and screamed , “ Why did you come here ? Why are you tormenting me ? Go away and leave me in peace ! ” And then the Rinpoche said , “ So now , where is your perfection of patience ? ” So that’s the point . We can create the ideal situation in which we have a very high opinion of ourselves , but how do we do when it comes to the big squeeze ?</h3>

There are three difficulties . The first is seeing neurosis as neurosis , and the second is being willing to do something different . The third difficulty is the aspiration to make this a way of life .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 130 &middot; Location 2050</div><div class='noteText'>Do something different , such as tonglen . Anything different would help , anything that’s not habitual . For example , you could go up and take a cold shower and sing at the top of your lungs , or drink a glass of water from the wrong side , like you do when you are trying to get rid of hiccups .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>21. High-Stakes Practice</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 135 &middot; Location 2125</div><div class='noteText'>Today’s slogan is “ Take on the three principal causes . ” The three principal causes are what help us to keep our heart open , to remember to exchange ourselves for others , and to communicate . They are the teacher , the teachings , and a precious human birth .</h3>

All your blind spots are going to come out with the spiritual friend . The only difference between the spiritual friend and everybody else in your life is that you’ve made a commitment to stick with him or her through thick or thin , better or worse , richer or poorer , in sickness and in death .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 136 &middot; Location 2149</div><div class='noteText'>When you’re with the spiritual friend or even thinking about him or her , you begin to see neurosis as neurosis . That encourages you to practice the second difficulty , which is to begin to apply the teachings . And finally , you long to make that a way of life . The spiritual friend does not confirm your existence but serves as a mirror for you to see where you’re stuck . The relationship encourages you to wake up .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 138 &middot; Location 2179</div><div class='noteText'>The refuge vow is a commitment not to seek islands of safety any longer but to learn how to leap , how to fly , how to leave the nest and go into uncharted territory , no longer hampered by tiny , self - centered views and opinions . The bodhisattva vow is highstakes practice because it’s about giving up privacy and the comfort orientation altogether as a way of awakening your heart further to yourself and to all sentient beings .</h3>

He was awake but smug . He suffered from what’s called spiritual pride . He was complaining about his girlfriend , who was having a hard time giving up smoking ; the anxiety was triggering an old eating disorder . The young man said he just kept telling her to be strong , not to be so fearful , to be disciplined . And she would tell him , “ I’m trying . I’m really trying . I’m doing the best I can . ” He was angry because it didn’t seem to him that she was trying . He said , “ I know I shouldn’t be getting so angry about this . I know I should be more compassionate . But I just can’t help it . It gets under my skin . I want to be more understanding , but she’s so stuck . ” Then he heard himself say , “ I’m trying . I’m really trying . I’m doing the best I can . ” When he heard himself saying her words , he got the message . He understood what she was up against , and it humbled him .</h3>
