> No. I can’t write a novel. I can’t write a play. I can’t write a song. But I can help the artist get that book or song or play noticed by the public. And that’s packaging. When you dig through all the craziness of my life, you’ll see that I’m just a guy from the Bronx who knows how to attract a crowd. I can get people to notice the sapphire, so it’s not lying in a cellar where it might be found in a hundred years, long after the man who mined it has died.

> But I had done a stupid thing. It did not take me long to realize my mistake. No matter how many packages I carried up the stairs, the tip stayed the same. There must be a business- school term for this: I was competing against myself, driving down my own prices. I figured out a solution. I would carry everything up in one trip, but hide the washing under the landing. First I would deliver just the dry cleaning, then loop back later to deliver the laundry. This way, I got two dimes instead of one.

# Everything but the Girl
Page 26 - Location 341

> Now, as I said, every few days, another crew of guys shipped in from the Aleutian Islands, picked up their checks, and went on a spree. So when these guys, chilled to the bone, holding their cash, came into the street, what’s the first thing they saw? The Sachs Men’s Shop. I decided to tell a story, to package a fantasy right in the big front window. I made a beach scene there, with a guy in a bathing suit sitting beside a gorgeous girl, drinking rum under an umbrella as waves break. The men stood there, mesmerized. Then they came in and talked to me. I took some of their money and in return set them up with a whole package, the plane tickets, the Florida hotel, the clothes, the beach stuff— everything but the girl. It was the Star of Ardaban all over again.

When you stood at the train station, waving good- bye, you did not understand what you were waving good- bye to— the world of your childhood dissolved behind you.

> I learned things at the Playhouse School that have been invaluable. About actors and artists for one, what drives them, what terrifies them ( this is often the same as what drives them ), what they need. ( Managing talent is my business, after all. ) These are people who do not make a product, perform an essential service, or, as my father would say, have an inventory, so even the most successful of them are haunted by the following thought: “Who really needs what I’m making? ”

> I learned a lot from the improv exercises, too. For me, this was less a matter of becoming another person or character than learning to trust the logic of my own mind. Sometimes, when you’re up against it, maybe this is an old Bronx thing, you just have to open your mouth and start talking. I can’t tell you how many jams I’ve gotten out of by talking, seeing where the words take me. “What are we going to do about it? ” “Well, I’ll tell you what we’re going to do about it … ” And I open my mouth and see what happens. That’s improv.

He said, “Tell me, O great Buddha, do you think we should keep Jerry Weintraub? Or should we let him go? ” He closed his eyes, as if he were meditating, communicating with the sages, then said to me, “The Buddha hasn’t made up his mind yet. ”

> On that first tour, I learned something new almost every night. Watching Sinatra work an audience of twenty thousand, take them up, bring them down, leave them in a kind of ecstatic high helped me in the movie business later on. It taught me how to structure a story: act one, act two, act three. Where did I go to school? Not to Harvard, Princeton, Stanford. I went to the school of Sinatra. I sat in his class every night. And while I was sitting there learning, I was making millions of dollars.

I sold him in the past tense, as someone you’ve known about for years. I was telling the audience to relax and enjoy, as the judgment has already been made. You love him!

> He led me down the hall to an empty boardroom. There was a round table with ornate chairs and leather blotters and beautiful lamps with green shades, each throwing a pool of light. Arthur sat at the head of the table, struck the gavel, then said, “Meeting in session. ” He read the main points of our contract aloud, asked if any members of the board were opposed, any objections, waited a moment, as if expecting an answer— “Good news, ” he said to me, “no objections ”— announced the contract ratified, then brought down the gavel, adjourning the meeting. “I did that for a reason, ” he explained. “I wanted to show you something. You’re going to make a lot of money. Do it yourself. Don’t ever go public. Be in charge of your own destiny. ”

> No rehab, no counseling, nothing like that. Just a moment of clarity, in which I saw myself from the outside, the mess I was making, the waste. I was slipping, not working as hard as I used to. I started leaving the office early on Fridays, then skipping Fridays altogether. Then I started leaving early on Thursdays, then arriving late on Mondays. I was letting myself go. Then one day, I just decided, It has to stop. I threw away the pills and bottles, took a cold shower, had a barbershop shave, and stepped into the cool of Sunset Boulevard, and began fresh.

As another great man said, You grow into the suit.
