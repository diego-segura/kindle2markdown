<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Introduction</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 8 &middot; Location 114</div><div class='noteText'>we have just two reasons that we may nonetheless fail .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 8 &middot; Location 114</div><div class='noteText'>The first is ignorance —</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 8 &middot; Location 116</div><div class='noteText'>The second type of failure the philosophers call ineptitude —</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>2. The Checklist</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 33 &middot; Location 413</div><div class='noteText'>The Boeing model was deemed , as a newspaper put it , “ too much airplane for one man to fly . ” The army air corps declared Douglas’s smaller design the winner . Boeing nearly went bankrupt .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 34 &middot; Location 430</div><div class='noteText'>Multiple fields , in other words , have become too much airplane for one person to fly .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 35 &middot; Location 444</div><div class='noteText'>In a complex environment , experts are up against two main difficulties . The first is the fallibility of human memory and attention , especially when it comes to mundane , routine matters that are easily overlooked under the strain of more pressing events .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 36 &middot; Location 448</div><div class='noteText'>all - or - none processes : whether running to the store to buy ingredients for a cake , preparing an airplane for takeoff , or evaluating a sick person in the hospital ,</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 36 &middot; Location 449</div><div class='noteText'>A further difficulty , just as insidious , is that people can lull themselves into skipping steps even when they remember them . In complex processes , after all , certain steps don’t always matter .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>3. The End of the Master Builder</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 55 &middot; Location 685</div><div class='noteText'>though all I managed to pick up was that I’d never before heard someone say “ quadratic equation ” in a Boston accent .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 65 &middot; Location 818</div><div class='noteText'>a “ submittal schedule . ” It was also a checklist , but it didn’t specify construction tasks ; it specified communication tasks .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 69 &middot; Location 863</div><div class='noteText'>the Citicorp ( now Citigroup ) building in midtown Manhattan , with its iconic slanted rooftop .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 69 &middot; Location 869</div><div class='noteText'>“ tuned mass damper . ” They could , he suggested , suspend an immense four - hundred - ton concrete block from huge springs in the building’s crown on the fifty - ninth floor , so that when wind pitched the building one way , the block would</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>4. The Idea</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 75 &middot; Location 943</div><div class='noteText'>The trouble wasn’t a lack of sympathy among top officials . It was a lack of understanding that , in the face of an extraordinarily complex problem , power needed to be pushed out of the center as far as possible . Everyone was waiting for the cavalry , but a centrally run , government - controlled solution was not going to be possible .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 79 &middot; Location 990</div><div class='noteText'>Instead , they require a seemingly contradictory mix of freedom and expectation — expectation to coordinate , for example , and also to measure progress toward common goals .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 79 &middot; Location 994</div><div class='noteText'>And for checklists to help achieve that balance , they have to take two almost opposing forms . They supply a set of checks to ensure the stupid but critical stuff is not overlooked , and they supply another set of checks to ensure people talk and coordinate and accept responsibility while nonetheless being left the power to manage the nuances and unpredictabilities the best they know how .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 84 &middot; Location 1058</div><div class='noteText'>A read - back was expected to confirm that the line cooks had heard the order right .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>5. The First Try</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 93 &middot; Location 1172</div><div class='noteText'>simple , measurable , transmissible —</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 108 &middot; Location 1361</div><div class='noteText'>people who don’t know one another’s names don’t work together nearly as well as those who do .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 108 &middot; Location 1367</div><div class='noteText'>“ activation phenomenon . ” Giving people a chance to say something at the start seemed to activate their sense of participation and responsibility and their willingness to speak up .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 111 &middot; Location 1404</div><div class='noteText'>It had three “ pause points , ” as they are called in aviation — three points at which the team must stop to run through a set of checks before proceeding .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>6. The Checklist Factory</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 120 &middot; Location 1510</div><div class='noteText'>Bad checklists are vague and imprecise . They are too long ; they are hard to use ; they are impractical .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 120 &middot; Location 1512</div><div class='noteText'>Good checklists , on the other hand , are precise . They are efficient , to the point , and easy to use even in the most difficult situations . They do not try to spell out everything — a checklist cannot fly a plane . Instead , they provide reminders of only the most critical and important steps — the ones that even the highly skilled professionals using them could miss . Good checklists are , above all , practical .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 123 &middot; Location 1546</div><div class='noteText'>You must decide whether you want a DO - CONFIRM checklist or a READ - DO checklist . With a DO - CONFIRM checklist , he said , team members perform their jobs from memory and experience , often separately . But then they stop . They pause to run the checklist and confirm that everything that was supposed to be done was done . With a READ - DO checklist , on the other hand , people carry out the tasks as they check them off — it’s more like a recipe .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 132 &middot; Location 1677</div><div class='noteText'>To begin with , we rarely investigate our failures . Not in medicine , not in teaching , not in the legal profession , not in the financial world , not in virtually any other kind of work where the mistakes do not turn up on cable news .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>7. The Test</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 155 &middot; Location 1951</div><div class='noteText'>Suppose this was just a Hawthorne effect , that is to say , a byproduct of being observed in a study rather than proof of the checklist’s power .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>8. The Hero in the Age of Checklists</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 163 &middot; Location 2049</div><div class='noteText'>They focus on dispassionate analysis , on avoiding both irrational exuberance and panic .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 165 &middot; Location 2077</div><div class='noteText'>So Pabrai made a list of mistakes he’d seen — ones Buffett and other investors had made as well as his own .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 166 &middot; Location 2094</div><div class='noteText'>He then designed detailed checklists to avoid the errors , complete with clearly identified pause points at which he and his investment team would run through the items .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 177 &middot; Location 2242</div><div class='noteText'>But step one on the list is the most fascinating . It is simply : FLY THE AIRPLANE .</h3>
