> The Boeing model was deemed, as a newspaper put it, “too much airplane for one man to fly. ” The army air corps declared Douglas’s smaller design the winner. Boeing nearly went bankrupt.

> In a complex environment, experts are up against two main difficulties. The first is the fallibility of human memory and attention, especially when it comes to mundane, routine matters that are easily overlooked under the strain of more pressing events.

> A further difficulty, just as insidious, is that people can lull themselves into skipping steps even when they remember them. In complex processes, after all, certain steps don’t always matter.

# 4. The Idea

> The trouble wasn’t a lack of sympathy among top officials. It was a lack of understanding that, in the face of an extraordinarily complex problem, power needed to be pushed out of the center as far as possible. Everyone was waiting for the cavalry, but a centrally run, government- controlled solution was not going to be possible.

> Instead, they require a seemingly contradictory mix of freedom and expectation— expectation to coordinate, for example, and also to measure progress toward common goals.

Page 79 - Location 994

> And for checklists to help achieve that balance, they have to take two almost opposing forms. They supply a set of checks to ensure the stupid but critical stuff is not overlooked, and they supply another set of checks to ensure people talk and coordinate and accept responsibility while nonetheless being left the power to manage the nuances and unpredictabilities the best they know how.

> Bad checklists are vague and imprecise. They are too long; they are hard to use; they are impractical.

Page 120 - Location 1512

> Good checklists, on the other hand, are precise. They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use even in the most difficult situations. They do not try to spell out everything— a checklist cannot fly a plane. Instead, they provide reminders of only the most critical and important steps— the ones that even the highly skilled professionals using them could miss. Good checklists are, above all, practical.

> You must decide whether you want a DO- CONFIRM checklist or a READ- DO checklist. With a DO- CONFIRM checklist, he said, team members perform their jobs from memory and experience, often separately. But then they stop. They pause to run the checklist and confirm that everything that was supposed to be done was done. With a READ- DO checklist, on the other hand, people carry out the tasks as they check them off— it’s more like a recipe.
