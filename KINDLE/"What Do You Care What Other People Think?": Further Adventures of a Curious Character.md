> If he wants to put a blue tile, let him put a blue tile. ” But my father said, “No, I want to show him what patterns are like and how interesting they are. It’s a kind of elementary mathematics. ” So he started very early to tell me about the world and how interesting it is.

> The next Monday, when the fathers were all back at work, we kids were playing in a field. One kid says to me, “See that bird? What kind of bird is that? ” I said, “I haven’t the slightest idea what kind of a bird it is. ” He says, “It’s a brown- throated thrush. Your father doesn’t teach you anything! ” But it was the opposite. He had already taught me: “See that bird? ” he says. “It’s a Spencer’s warbler. ” ( I knew he didn’t know the real name. ) “Well, in Italian, it’s a Chutto Lapittida. In Portuguese, it’s a Bom da Peida. In Chinese, it’s a Chung- long- tah, and in Japanese, it’s a Katano Tekeda. You can know the name of that bird in all the languages of the world, but when you’re finished, you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. You’ll only know about humans in different places, and what they call the bird. So let’s look at the bird and see what it’s doing— that’s what counts. ” ( I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something. )

> “Say, Pop, I noticed something. When I pull the wagon, the ball rolls to the back of the wagon. And when I’m pulling it along and I suddenly stop, the ball rolls to the front of the wagon. Why is that? ” “That, nobody knows, ” he said. “The general principle is that things which are moving tend to keep on moving, and things which are standing still tend to stand still, unless you push them hard. This tendency is called ‘inertia, ’ but nobody knows why it’s true. ” Now, that’s a deep understanding. He didn’t just give me the name.

> One time we were looking at a picture of the pope and everybody bowing in front of him. My father said, “Now, look at those humans. Here’s one human standing here, and all these others are bowing in front of him. Now, what’s the difference? This one is the pope ”— he hated the pope anyway. He said, “This difference is the hat he’s wearing. ” ( If it was a general, it was the epaulets. It was always the costume, the uniform, the position. ) “But, ” he said, “this man has the same problems as everybody else: he eats dinner; he goes to the bathroom. He’s a human being. ” ( By the way, my father was in the uniform business, so he knew what the difference is in a man with the uniform off and the uniform on— it was the same man for him. )

> Although my mother didn’t know anything about science, she had a great influence on me as well. In particular, she had a wonderful sense of humor, and I learned from her that the highest forms of understanding we can achieve are laughter and human compassion.

> Barbara says to me, “Thank you for a very lovely evening. ” “You’re welcome! ” I answered. I felt terrific. The next time I went out on a date— it was with a different girl— I say goodnight to her, and she says, “Thank you for a very lovely evening. ” I didn’t feel quite so terrific. When I said goodnight to the third girl I took out, she’s got her mouth open, ready to speak, and I say, “Thank you for a very lovely evening! ” She says, “Thank you— uh— Oh!— Yes— uh, I had a lovely evening, too, thank you! ”

> I was about to write a simple theme about this dumb question when I remembered that my literary friends were always “throwing the bull ”— building up their sentences to sound complex and sophisticated. I decided to try it, just for the hell of it. I thought, “If the Regents are so silly as to have a subject like the importance of science in aviation, I’m gonna do that. ” So I wrote stuff like, “Aeronautical science is important in the analysis of the eddies, vortices, and whirlpools formed in the atmosphere behind the aircraft … ”— I knew that eddies, vortices, and whirlpools are the same thing, but mentioning them three different ways sounds better! That was the only thing I would not have ordinarily done on the test. The teacher who corrected my examination must have been impressed by eddies, vortices, and whirlpools, because I got a 91 on the exam— while my literary friends, who chose topics the English teachers could more easily take issue with, both got 88. That year a new rule came out: if you got 90 or better on a Regents examination, you automatically got honors in that subject at graduation! So while the playwright and the editor of the school newspaper had to stay in their seats, this illiterate fool physics student was called to go up to the stage once again and receive honors in English!

> Arlene and I began to mold each other’s personality. She lived in a family that was very polite, and was very sensitive to other people’s feelings. She taught me to be more sensitive to those kinds of things, too. On the other hand, her family felt that “white lies ” were okay. I thought one should have the attitude of “What do you care what other people think! ” I said, “We should listen to other people’s opinions and take them into account. Then, if they don’t make sense and we think they’re wrong, then that’s that! ” Arlene caught on to the idea right away. It was easy to talk her into thinking that in our relationship, we must be very honest with each other and say everything straight, with absolute frankness. It worked very well, and we became very much in love— a love like no other love that I know of.

> In those days we didn’t have extra stuff, so I didn’t want to waste the pencils. I got a razor blade from the bathroom and cut off the writing on one of them to see if I could use them. The next morning, I get a letter in the mail. It starts out, “WHAT’S THE IDEA OF TRYING TO CUT THE NAME OFF THE PENCILS? ” It continues: “Aren’t you proud of the fact that I love you? ” Then: “WHAT DO YOU CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK? ” Then came poetry: “If you’re ashamed of me, dah dah, then Pecans to you! Pecans to you! ” The next verse was the same kind of stuff, with the last line, “Almonds to you! Almonds to you! ” Each one was “Nuts to you! ” in a different form. So I had to use the pencils with the names on them. What else could I do?

> I write, “Look: you’re way out of scale! ” Soon another catalog comes: it’s for various kinds of motor boats— Chriscraft this and that. I write, “Too expensive! ” Finally, I get a note: “This is your last chance, Richard. You’re always saying no. ” It turns out a friend of hers has a rowboat she wants to sell for $ 15— a used rowboat— and maybe we could buy it so we could row around in the water next summer. So, yes. I mean, how can you say no after all that?

> I learned what she meant. There’s a particular way you have to make the stroke for it to look good. An aesthetic thing has a certain set, a certain character, which I can’t define. Because it couldn’t be defined made me think there was nothing to it.

> It’s hard to explain. If a Martian ( who, we’ll imagine, never dies except by accident ) came to Earth and saw this peculiar race of creatures— these humans who live about seventy or eighty years, knowing that death is going to come— it would look to him like a terrible problem of psychology to live under those circumstances, knowing that life is only temporary. Well, we humans somehow figure out how to live despite this problem: we laugh, we joke, we live. The only difference for me and Arlene was; instead of fifty years, it was five years. It was only a quantitative difference— the psychological problem was just the same. The only way it would have become any different is if we had said to ourselves, “But those other people have it better, because they might live fifty years. ”

> One night I had a dream, and Arlene came into it. Right away, I said to her, “No, no, you can’t be in this dream. You’re not alive! ” Then later, I had another dream with Arlene in it. I started in again, saying, “You can’t be in this dream! ” “No, no, ” she says. “I fooled you. I was tired of you, so I cooked up this ruse so I could go my own way. But now I like you again, so I’ve come back. ” My mind was really working against itself. It had to be explained, even in a goddamn dream, why it was possible that she was still there! I must have done something to myself, psychologically. I didn’t cry until about a month later, when I was walking past a department store in Oak Ridge and noticed a pretty dress in the window. I thought, “Arlene would like that, ” and then it hit me.

> “But thinking is nothing but talking to yourself inside. ” “Oh yeah? ” Bernie said. “Do you know the crazy shape of the crankshaft in a car? ” “Yeah, what of it? ” “Good. Now, tell me: how did you describe it when you were talking to yourself? ” So I learned from Bernie that thoughts can be visual as well as verbal.

> We talked about it a while, and we discovered something. It turned out that Tukey was counting in a different way: he was visualizing a tape with numbers on it going by. He would say, “Mary had a little lamb, ” and he would watch it! Well, now it was clear: he’s “looking ” at his tape going by, so he can’t read, and I’m “talking ” to myself when I’m counting, so I can’t speak!

So she was the one who had made the mistake, not me ( which is usually the case ). Or was she just being polite?

But he acted as if he understood exactly what I said, and he “translated ” it with complete confidence for everyone. He was much like I am, in this respect.

> Except for one thing: among all those art objects there was one thing so entirely different and strange that it is nearly impossible. It was recovered from the sea in 1900 and is some kind of machine with gear trains, very much like the inside of a modern wind- up alarm clock. The teeth are very regular and many wheels are fitted closely together. There are graduated circles and Greek inscriptions. I wonder if it is some kind of fake. There was an article on it in the Scientific American in 1959.

> They were very upset when I said that the development of greatest importance to mathematics in Europe was the discovery by Tartaglia that you can solve a cubic equation: although it is of very little use in itself, the discovery must have been psychologically wonderful because it showed that a modern man could do something no ancient Greek could do. It therefore helped in the Renaissance, which was the freeing of man from the intimidation of the ancients. What the Greeks are learning in school is to be intimidated into thinking they have fallen so far below their super ancestors.

I am not going to sleep in this place, ” picked up his suitcase, and walked off alone into the woods. In the morning he reappeared, looking none the worse for his night under the stars. He said he did not sleep much, but it was worth it.

I could only think of this: it’s very hard to get through to the president; I also can’t just call up an astronaut and talk to her— if she’s in space. Therefore, switching the signals down from the shuttle over to the president while he’s talking to Congress must be a complicated business. To find out whether anybody had set up to do that, I went down to the lowest levels and asked guys at the bottom some technical questions.

> The assembly workers had other observations and suggestions. They were concerned that if two rocket sections scrape as they’re being put together, metal filings could get into the rubber seals and damage them. They even had some suggestions for redesigning the seal. Those suggestions weren’t very good, but the point is, the workers were thinking! I got the impression that they were not undisciplined; they were very interested in what they were doing, but they weren’t being given much encouragement. Nobody was paying much attention to them. It was remarkable that their morale was as high as it was under the circumstances.

Mr. Lamberth’s admonishment went down through the levels until somebody in middle management realized that Mr. Fichtel had gone by the book, and that the error was in the manual. But instead of telling Mr. Lamberth about the error, they simply threw away the admonishment, and just kept quiet.

> Maybe they don’t say explicitly “Don’t tell me, ” but they discourage communication, which amounts to the same thing. It’s not a question of what has been written down, or who should tell what to whom; it’s a question of whether, when you do tell somebody about some problem, they’re delighted to hear about it and they say “Tell me more ” and “Have you tried such- and- such? ” or they say “Well, see what you can do about it ”— which is a completely different atmosphere. If you try once or twice to communicate and get pushed back, pretty soon you decide, “To hell with it. ”

You don’t have to tell me there’s a baby on board; I’m gonna drive carefully anyway! What am I supposed to do when I see there’s a baby on board: act differently? As if I’m suddenly gonna drive more carefully and not hit the car because there’s a baby on board, when all I’m trying to do is not hit it anyway! So NASA was trying to get the shuttle up anyway: you don’t have to say there’s a baby on board, or there’s a teacher on board, or it’s important to get this one up for the President.
