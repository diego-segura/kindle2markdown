<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Community</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 178</div><div class='noteText'>one person in particular who will spare us any need for people in general .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 187</div><div class='noteText'>Given this level of discrimination , it is no surprise that many of us choose to throw ourselves with a vengeance into our careers . Focusing on work to the exclusion of almost everything else is a plausible enough strategy in a world which accepts workplace achievements as the main tokens with which we can secure not just the financial means to survive physically , but also the attention that we require to thrive psychologically</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 234</div><div class='noteText'>As a result , we may start to feel that we could work a little less feverishly , because we see that the respect and security we hope to gain through our careers is already available to us in a warm and impressive community which imposes no worldly requirements on us for its welcome .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 318</div><div class='noteText'>these talking points would be carefully crafted for a specific purpose , to coax guests away from customary expressions of superbia ( ‘ What do you do ? ’ , ‘ Where do your children go to school ? ’ ) and towards a more sincere revelation of themselves ( ‘ What do you regret ? ’ , ‘ Whom can you not forgive ? ’ , ‘ What do you fear ? ’ ) .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 366</div><div class='noteText'>Falling on the tenth day of Tishrei , shortly after the beginning of the Jewish new year , the Day of Atonement ( or Yom Kippur ) is a solemn</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 393</div><div class='noteText'>I made you cry , an incident that neither of us can quite forget but that we can’t quite mention either and which has been slowly corroding the trust and love we once had for each other .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 394</div><div class='noteText'>It is the day that has given us the opportunity , indeed the responsibility , to stop talking of our usual business and to reopen a case we pretended to have put out of our minds . We are not satisfying ourselves , we are obeying the rules .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 401</div><div class='noteText'>and it is this imbalance of power that is keeping us quiet , yet not for that matter saving us from bitterness and suppressed rage .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 405</div><div class='noteText'>Our victims hence have to suffer not only the original hurt , but also the subsequent coldness we display towards them on account of our tormented consciences .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 450</div><div class='noteText'>They hence give us special days under the cover of which our pestiferous feelings can be processed . They give us lines to recite and songs to sing while they carry us across the treacherous regions of our psyches .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 480</div><div class='noteText'>both sides knowing that it was nothing personal , that it was the Feast of Fools that made them do it .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Kindness</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 594</div><div class='noteText'>We no longer have to be brought into line by the threat of hell or the promise of paradise ; we merely have to be reminded that it is we ourselves – that is , the most mature and reasonable parts of us ( seldom present in the midst of our crises and obsessions ) – who want to lead the sort of life which we once imagined supernatural beings demanded of us .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 721</div><div class='noteText'>Lincoln or Whitman , Churchill or Stendhal , Warren Buffett or Paul Smith</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Education</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 780</div><div class='noteText'>Graduation speeches stereotypically identify liberal education with the acquisition of wisdom and self - knowledge , but these goals have little bearing on the day - to - day methods of departmental instruction and examination .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 825</div><div class='noteText'>We are unwilling to consider secular culture religiously enough , in other words , as a source of guidance .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 850</div><div class='noteText'>In contrast , Christianity concerns itself from the outset with the inner confused side of us , declaring that we are none of us born knowing how to live ;</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 874</div><div class='noteText'>Sermons by their very nature assume that their audiences are in important ways lost .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 893</div><div class='noteText'>In the secular sphere , we may well be reading the right books , but we too often fail to ask direct questions of them ,</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 894</div><div class='noteText'>declining to advance sufficiently vulgar , neo - religious enquiries because we are embarrassed to admit to the true nature of our inner needs .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 922</div><div class='noteText'>they would teach this material with a view to illuminating students ’ lives rather than merely prodding at academic goals . Anna Karenina and Madame Bovary would thus be assigned in a course on understanding the tensions of marriage instead of in one focused on narrative trends in nineteenth - century fiction , just as the recommendations of Epicurus and Seneca would appear in the syllabus for a course about dying rather than in a survey of Hellenistic philosophy .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 930</div><div class='noteText'>would establish a Department for Relationships , an Institute of Dying and a Centre for Self - Knowledge</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1056</div><div class='noteText'>Moved though we may be by Leaves of Grass or the Meditations , we deny that there might be any need , if we wish these books to have a genuine influence on our lives , of revisiting them daily .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1081</div><div class='noteText'>We feel guilty for all that we have not yet read , but overlook how much better read we already are than Augustine or Dante , thereby ignoring that our problem lies squarely with our manner of absorption rather than with the extent of our consumption .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1109</div><div class='noteText'>abeyance</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1171</div><div class='noteText'>think about what our lives might be like if we were not burdened by the additional and painful need to be ourselves .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1217</div><div class='noteText'>Buddhist poetry is dominated by records of similar encounters with just such tiny facets of the world , which reach our senses only after our egos have loosened their grip on our faculties .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Tenderness</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1314</div><div class='noteText'>At such moments we may long to be held and reassured , as we were decades ago by some sympathetic adult , most likely our mother , a person who made us feel physically protected , stroked our hair , looked at us with benevolence and tenderness and perhaps said not very much other than , very quietly , ‘ of course ’ .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Pessimism</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1372</div><div class='noteText'>chimera</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1383</div><div class='noteText'>It is hope – with regard to our careers , our love lives , our children , our politicians and our planet – that is primarily to blame for angering and embittering us .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1384</div><div class='noteText'>The incompatibility between the grandeur of our aspirations and the mean reality of our condition generates the violent disappointments which rack our days and etch themselves in lines of acrimony across our faces .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1413</div><div class='noteText'>With no evident awareness of the contradiction they may , in the same breath , gruffly dismiss a belief in angels while sincerely trusting that the combined powers of the IMF , the medical research establishment , Silicon Valley and democratic politics could together cure the ills of mankind .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1429</div><div class='noteText'>as a mechanism by which individuals can assume an adult position in society and thence , with the help of a close friend , undertake to nurture and educate the next generation under divine guidance .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1437</div><div class='noteText'>‘ Why can’t you be more perfect ? ’ is the incensed question that lurks beneath a majority of secular arguments .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1476</div><div class='noteText'>jealous stalemates</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Perspective</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1547</div><div class='noteText'>sub specie aeternitatis</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1557</div><div class='noteText'>Science should matter to us not only because it helps us to control parts of the world , but also because it shows us things that we will never master .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Art</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1665</div><div class='noteText'>From the fourteenth century to the end of the nineteenth , a brotherhood in Rome was renowned for tracking down prisoners on their way to the gallows and placing before their eyes tavolette , or small boards bearing images from the Christian story – usually of Christ on the Cross or the Virgin and Child – in the hope that these representations would bring the condemned solace in their final minutes . It is difficult to conceive of a more extreme example of a belief in the redemptive capacity of images , and yet the brotherhood was only carrying out a mission to which Christian art has always been committed : that of putting examples of the most important ideas in front of us at difficult moments , to help us to live and to die .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1694</div><div class='noteText'>attenuate</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1739</div><div class='noteText'>we should learn to regard all our fellow human beings as if they were children . Our enemies too were once infants , in need of attention ( rather than bad ) , fifty centimetres long , breathing softly on their stomachs , smelling of milk and talcum powder .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1837</div><div class='noteText'>The religion additionally gives us mantras to repeat as we look , most often ‘ Om mani padme hum ’ ( translated from the Sanskrit as ‘ Generosity - ethics - patience - diligence - renunciation - wisdom ’ ) ,</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1843</div><div class='noteText'>works of art are not diminished by being accompanied by instruction manuals .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1873</div><div class='noteText'>Museums must be more than places for displaying beautiful objects . They should be places that use beautiful objects in order to try to make us good and wise . Only then will museums be able to claim that they have properly fulfilled the noble but still elusive ambition of becoming our new churches .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Architecture</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1942</div><div class='noteText'>What if our minds are susceptible to more than just the books we read ? What if we are also influenced by the houses , hospitals and factories around us ? Might we not hence have good reason to mount protests against ugliness – and , despite a thousand obstacles , strive to put up buildings that could advance a case for goodness through their beauty ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1985</div><div class='noteText'>The advantages of being made to feel small : Tadao Ando , Christian Church of the Light , Ibaraki , Japan , 1989 . ( illustration credit 9.5 )</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 1998</div><div class='noteText'>science leaned upon for its therapeutic , perspective - giving capacity rather than for its factual value .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2012</div><div class='noteText'>A Temple to Reflection would lend structure and legitimacy to moments of solitude . It would be a simple space , offering visitors little beyond a bench or two , a vista and a suggestion that they set to work on unravelling some of the troubling themes that they have been using their normal activity to suppress .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2078</div><div class='noteText'>Although few of us would today walk a hundred kilometres to seek help for a fear of lightning , travelling nevertheless remains at the heart of many secular ideas of fulfilment . Our trips retain a role in cementing important inner transitions .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2098</div><div class='noteText'>A psychotherapeutic travel agency would align mental disorders with the parts of the planet best able to alleviate them . ( illustration</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Institutions</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2121</div><div class='noteText'>In his Republic , Plato conveyed a touching understanding ( born from experience ) of the limits of the lone intellectual , when he remarked that the world would not be set right until philosophers became kings , or kings philosophers . In other words , writing books can’t be enough if one wishes to change things .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2234</div><div class='noteText'>that BMW’s concern for rigour and precision has ended so conclusively at the bumpers of its cars rather than stretching to the founding of a school or of a political party , or that Giorgio Armani’s eponymous corporation has determinedly skirted the possibility of running a therapy unit or a liberal arts college .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 2397</div><div class='noteText'>how to cancel out the current bias towards commercial values in advertising , how to select and make use of secular saints , how to rethink the strategies of universities and our approach to cultural education , how to redesign hotels and spas , how better to acknowledge our own childlike needs , how to surrender some of our counterproductive optimism , how to achieve perspective through the sublime and the transcendent , how to reorganize museums , how to use architecture to enshrine values – and , finally , how to coalesce the scattered efforts of individuals interested in the care of souls and organize them under the aegis of institutions .</h3>
