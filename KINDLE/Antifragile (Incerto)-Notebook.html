I get mellow and lose physical energy when it rains , become more meditative , and tend to write more and more slowly then , with the raindrops hitting the window , what Verlaine called autumnal “ sobs ” ( sanglots ) . Some days I enter poetic melancholic states , what the Portuguese call saudade or the Turks hüzün ( from the Arabic word for sadness ) .

He imbued his writings with his own risk taking : Malraux was a school dropout — while extremely well read — who became an adventurer in Asia in his twenties . He was an active pilot during the Spanish Civil War and later an active member of the French underground resistance during the Second World War . He turned out to be a bit of a mythomaniac , unnecessarily glorifying his meetings with great men and statesmen . He just could not bear the idea of a writer being an intellectual . But unlike Hemingway , who was mostly into image building , he was the real thing . And he never engaged in small talk — his biographer reports that while other writers were discussing copyrights and royalties , he would steer the conversation to theology ( he supposedly said the twenty - first century will be religious or will not be ) . One of my saddest days was when he died .</h3>
