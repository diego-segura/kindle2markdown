> Karl expressed his approach to design in Top Ten Designers in Paris, a television documentary made in 1979 during the ready- to- wear collections that featured Karl. ‘It’s not very modern any more, I think, to talk about the new silhouette.The mood is more important than the line in a way because we are not in the ’ 50s any more when there was the A- line and the H- line and the I don’t know what, you know, so it’s more a spirit and atmosphere. The only thing you can say is the shoulders are still broad, the waist is not as slim as it was last year and a little shorter, but this to me sounds like old- fashioned talk of the ’ 50s. ’ Later he adds, ‘The whole statement is made with accessories and all the different things I add. The clothes are in fact quite simple and I wouldn’t say basic but, in fact, very easy. ’

Page 267 - Location 4553

> Whatever the reason, Karl’s absence at the funeral of his father and beloved mother is a striking reaction of denial in the face of death and calls to mind something a former colleague says of Karl: ‘If you want to understand Karl, you have to understand his fear of death. He cannot bear sickness. If he has a cold it is this huge drama. He cannot stand the idea of someone sitting next to him with germs. He talks about the future non- stop because when he looks at the past he realises that life is behind him and there is only a small portion ahead. This is what makes him work so hard. He hates the idea of being confronted with himself. ’

> The spencer jacket is a fine example of this: both Lagerfeld and Claude Montana had indeed featured a spencer jacket in their collections the season before Yves, but Yves Saint Laurent’s Broadway collection effectively obliterated theirs. He threw a curve at the lapel that was ease and elegance, chopped the trouser at the ankle to balance the silhouette, made it a black woman’s collection of Southern colours and elegance, played the Porgy and Bess soundtrack, put his dog on the stage, had the crowds foot- stomping and roaring, so that by the end of the couture collection only Saint Laurent’s vision remained.
