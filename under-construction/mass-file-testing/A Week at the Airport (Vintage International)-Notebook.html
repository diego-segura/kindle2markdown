De Botton, Alain
</div></h1><hr/>

<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter I - Approach</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 1 &middot; Location 52</div><div class='noteText'>It seemed astonishing and touching that in our distracted age , literature could have retained sufficient prestige to inspire a multinational enterprise , otherwise focused on the management of landing fees and effluents , to underwrite a venture invested with such elevated artistic ambitions . Nevertheless , as the man from the airport company put it to me over the telephone , with a lyricism as vague as it was beguiling , there were still many aspects of the world that perhaps only writers could be counted on to find the right words to express . A glossy marketing brochure , while in certain contexts a supremely effective instrument of communication , might not always convey the authenticity achievable by a single authorial voice – or , as my friend suggested with greater concision , could more easily be dismissed as ‘ bullshit ’ .</h3>

<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter II - Departures</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 8 &middot; Location 114</div><div class='noteText'>The hotel room appeared to have taken its design cues from the business - class cabin – though it was hard to say for sure which had inspired which , whether the room was skilfully endeavouring to look like a cabin , or the cabin a room – or whether they simply both shared in an unconscious spirit of their age , of the kind that had once ensured continuity between the lace trim on mid - eighteenth - century evening dresses and the iron detailing on the façades of Georgian town houses .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 21 &middot; Location 242</div><div class='noteText'>On reaching home , a passenger would remember nothing of the plane that had not crashed or the suitcase that had arrived within minutes of the carousel’s starting if , upon politely asking for a window seat , she had been brusquely admonished to be happy with whatever she was assigned – this retort stemming from a sense on the part of a member of the check - in team ( perhaps discouraged by a bad head cold or a disappointing evening at a nightclub ) of the humiliating and unjust nature of existence .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 22 &middot; Location 258</div><div class='noteText'>inculcate</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 23 &middot; Location 262</div><div class='noteText'>all so that today , without any thanks being given to those parents ( a category deserving to be generally known as the true Human Resources department of global capitalism ) , he would have both the will and the wherewithal to reassure an anxious student on her way to the gate to catch BA048 to Philadelphia .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 24 &middot; Location 273</div><div class='noteText'>I was reminded of the Roman philosopher Seneca’s treatise On Anger , written for the benefit of the Emperor Nero , and in particular of its thesis that the root cause of anger is hope .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 24 &middot; Location 275</div><div class='noteText'>A man who screams every time he loses his keys or is turned away at an airport is evincing a touching but recklessly naïve belief in a world in which keys never go astray and our travel plans are invariably assured .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 46 &middot; Location 470</div><div class='noteText'>The psychoanalyst Melanie Klein , in her Envy and Gratitude ( 1963 ) , traced this latent sense of guilt back to an intrinsic part of human nature , originating in our Oedipal desire to murder our same - sex parent . So strong can the guilty feeling become in adulthood that it may provoke a compulsion to make false confessions to those in authority , or even to commit actual crimes as a means of gaining a measure of relief from an otherwise overwhelming impression of having done something wrong .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 50 &middot; Location 506</div><div class='noteText'>There was no shortage , including several with feature articles on how to look good after forty – advice of course predicated on the assumption that one’s appearance had been pleasing at thirty - nine ( the writer’s age ) .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 54 &middot; Location 541</div><div class='noteText'>The cadence of his speech was impressively slow and deliberate , like that of a scholar unable to ignore , even for a moment , the nuances behind every statement , and accustomed to living in environments where these could be investigated to their furthest conclusions</h3>

What is the end of the pursuit of wealth , power and pre - eminence ? ’ asked Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments ( 1759 ) , going on to answer , ‘ To be observed , to be attended to , to be taken notice of with sympathy , complacency , and approbation ’</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 58 &middot; Location 591</div><div class='noteText'>These were not the chinless heirs to hectares of countryside but rather normal people who had figured out how to make the microchip and spreadsheet work on their behalf .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 74 &middot; Location 745</div><div class='noteText'>At night , the airport emerged as a home of nomadic spirits , types who could not commit to any one country , who shied from tradition and were suspicious of settled community , and who were therefore nowhere more comfortable than in the intermediate zones of the modern world , landscapes gashed by kerosene storage tanks , business parks and airport hotels .</h3>
