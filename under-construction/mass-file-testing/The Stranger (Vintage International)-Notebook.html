<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Part One</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 1 &gt; Page 3 &middot; Location 74</div><div class='noteText'>Maman died today .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 1 &gt; Page 7 &middot; Location 127</div><div class='noteText'>He’d told me that they had to bury her quickly , because it gets hot in the plains , especially in this part of the country . That was when he told me he had lived in Paris and that he had found it hard to forget it . In Paris they keep vigil over the body for three , sometimes four days . But here you barely have time to get used to the idea before you have to start running after the hearse .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 1 &gt; Page 10 &middot; Location 153</div><div class='noteText'>I’d never noticed what huge stomachs old women can have .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 1 &gt; Page 12 &middot; Location 180</div><div class='noteText'>and I could feel how much I’d enjoy going for a walk if it hadn’t been for Maman .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 1 &gt; Page 17 &middot; Location 243</div><div class='noteText'>Several other images from that day have stuck in my mind : for instance , Pérez’s face when he caught up with us for the last time , just outside the village . Big tears of frustration and exhaustion were streaming down his cheeks . But because of all the wrinkles , they weren’t dripping off . They spread out and ran together again , leaving a watery film over his ruined face . Then there was the church and the villagers on the sidewalks , the red geraniums on the graves in the cemetery , Pérez fainting ( he crumpled like a rag doll ) , the blood - red earth spilling over Maman’s casket , the white flesh of the roots mixed in with it , more people , voices , the village , waiting in front of a café , the incessant drone of the motor , and my joy when the bus entered the nest of lights that was Algiers and I knew I was going to go to bed and sleep for twelve hours .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter 1 &gt; Page 18 &middot; Location 249</div><div class='noteText'>Great images and time warp</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 2 &gt; Page 20 &middot; Location 266</div><div class='noteText'>I felt like telling her it wasn’t my fault , but I stopped myself because I remembered that I’d already said that to my boss . It didn’t mean anything . Besides , you always feel a little guilty .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 2 &gt; Page 24 &middot; Location 311</div><div class='noteText'>I shut my windows , and as I was coming back I glanced at the mirror and saw a corner of my table with my alcohol lamp next to some pieces of bread . It occurred to me that anyway one more Sunday was over , that Maman was buried now , that I was going back to work , and that , really , nothing had changed .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 3 &gt; Page 26 &middot; Location 326</div><div class='noteText'>Céleste was there , as always , with his big belly , his apron , and his white moustache . He asked me if things were “ all right now . ” I told him yes they were and said I was hungry . I ate fast and had some coffee . Then I went home and slept for a while because I’d drunk too much wine , and when I woke up I felt like having a smoke .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 3 &gt; Page 26 &middot; Location 330</div><div class='noteText'>But I went straight home because I wanted to boil myself some potatoes .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 3 &gt; Page 28 &middot; Location 350</div><div class='noteText'>And once he said to me , talking about Salamano , “ If that isn’t pitiful ! ” He asked me didn’t I think it was disgusting and I said no .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 3 &gt; Page 29 &middot; Location 367</div><div class='noteText'>“ I knew this lady … as a matter of fact , well , she was my mistress</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 3 &gt; Page 32 &middot; Location 404</div><div class='noteText'>because I didn’t have any reason not to please him .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 3 &gt; Page 33 &middot; Location 407</div><div class='noteText'>I didn’t mind being his pal , and he seemed set on it .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 4 &gt; Page 35 &middot; Location 431</div><div class='noteText'>When she laughed I wanted her again . A minute later she asked me if I loved her . I told her it didn’t mean anything but that I didn’t think so . She looked sad . But as we were fixing lunch , and for no apparent reason , she laughed in such a way that I kissed her .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 4 &gt; Page 37 &middot; Location 456</div><div class='noteText'>I said I wasn’t expecting anything ,</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 4 &gt; Page 37 &middot; Location 458</div><div class='noteText'>It didn’t matter to me ,</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 4 &gt; Page 38 &middot; Location 460</div><div class='noteText'>but I said no ,</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 4 &gt; Page 39 &middot; Location 477</div><div class='noteText'>“ They’re not going to take him away from me , are they , Monsieur Meursault</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 4 &gt; Page 39 &middot; Location 480</div><div class='noteText'>And from the peculiar little noise coming through the partition , I realized he was crying .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 5 &gt; Page 41 &middot; Location 494</div><div class='noteText'>but that really it was all the same to me .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 5 &gt; Page 41 &middot; Location 495</div><div class='noteText'>I said that people never change their lives , that in any case one life was as good as another and that I wasn’t dissatisfied with mine here at all . He looked upset and told me that I never gave him a straight answer , that I had no ambition , and that that was disastrous in business . So I went back to work . I would rather not have upset him , but I couldn’t see any reason to change my life . Looking back on it , I wasn’t unhappy . When I was a student , I had lots of ambitions like that . But when I had to give up my studies I learned very quickly that none of it really mattered .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 5 &gt; Page 41 &middot; Location 502</div><div class='noteText'>she was the one who was doing the asking and all I was saying was yes .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 5 &gt; Page 42 &middot; Location 506</div><div class='noteText'>she mumbled that I was peculiar , that that was probably why she loved me</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 5 &gt; Page 46 &middot; Location 550</div><div class='noteText'>“ I hope the dogs don’t bark tonight . I always think it’s mine . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 6 &gt; Page 49 &middot; Location 577</div><div class='noteText'>promontory</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Part Two</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 1 &gt; Page 64 &middot; Location 704</div><div class='noteText'>On my way out I was even going to shake his hand , but just in time , I remembered that I had killed a man .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 1 &gt; Page 71 &middot; Location 782</div><div class='noteText'>I was almost surprised that I had ever enjoyed anything other than those rare moments when the judge would lead me to the door of his office , slap me on the shoulder , and say to me cordially , “ That’s all for today , Monsieur Antichrist . ’ I would then be handed back over to the police .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 2 &gt; Page 77 &middot; Location 840</div><div class='noteText'>At the time , I often thought that if I had had to live in the trunk of a dead tree , with nothing to do but look up at the sky flowering overhead , little by little I would have gotten used to it . I would have waited for birds to fly by or clouds to mingle , just as here I waited to see my lawyer’s ties and just as , in another world , I used to wait patiently until Saturday to hold Marie’s body in my arms .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 2 &gt; Page 79 &middot; Location 872</div><div class='noteText'>A man had left a Czech village to seek his fortune . Twenty - five years later , and now rich , he had returned with a wife and a child . His mother was running a hotel with his sister in the village where he’d been born . In order to surprise them , he had left his wife and child at another hotel and gone to see his mother , who didn’t recognize him when he walked in . As a joke he’d had the idea of taking a room . He had shown off his money . During the night his mother and his sister had beaten him to death with a hammer in order to rob him and had thrown his body in the river . The next morning the wife had come to the hotel and , without knowing it , gave away the traveler’s identity . The mother hanged herself . The sister threw herself down a well . I must have read that story a thousand times .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 2 &gt; Page 80 &middot; Location 878</div><div class='noteText'>Anyway , I thought the traveler pretty much deserved what he got and that you should never play games .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 2 &gt; Page 81 &middot; Location 891</div><div class='noteText'>Then I remembered what the nurse at Maman’s funeral said .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 3 &gt; Page 82 &middot; Location 897</div><div class='noteText'>parricide</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 3 &gt; Page 86 &middot; Location 936</div><div class='noteText'>( each time , the jurors ’ heads would all turn toward the bench at the same time ) ;</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 3 &gt; Page 90 &middot; Location 982</div><div class='noteText'>It was then I felt a stirring go through the room and for the first time I realized that I was guilty .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 3 &gt; Page 91 &middot; Location 996</div><div class='noteText'>The prosecutor asked him if he had at least seen me cry . Pérez answered no . The prosecutor in turn said , “ The gentlemen of the jury will take note . ” But my lawyer got angry . He asked Pérez in what seemed to be an exaggerated tone of voice if he had seen me not cry . Pérez said , “ No . ” The spectators laughed .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 4 &gt; Page 98 &middot; Location 1066</div><div class='noteText'>Even in the prisoner’s dock it’s always interesting to hear people talk about you .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 4 &gt; Page 98 &middot; Location 1074</div><div class='noteText'>Besides , I have to admit that whatever interest you can get people to take in you doesn’t last very long . For example , I got bored very quickly with the prosecutor’s speech . Only bits and pieces — a gesture or a long but isolated tirade — caught my attention or aroused my interest .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 4 &gt; Page 100 &middot; Location 1093</div><div class='noteText'>Of course , I couldn’t help admitting that he was right . I didn’t feel much remorse for what I’d done . But I was surprised by how relentless he was . I would have liked to have tried explaining to him cordially , almost affectionately , that I had never been able to truly feel remorse for anything .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 5 &gt; Page 110 &middot; Location 1194</div><div class='noteText'>How had I not seen that there was nothing more important than an execution , and that when you come right down to it , it was the only thing a man could truly be interested in ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 5 &gt; Page 116 &middot; Location 1260</div><div class='noteText'>“ Why have you refused to see me ? ” he asked . I said that I didn’t believe in God . He wanted to know if I was sure and I said that I didn’t see any reason to ask myself that question : it seemed unimportant .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 5 &gt; Page 116 &middot; Location 1265</div><div class='noteText'>He looked away and without moving asked me if I wasn’t talking that way out of extreme despair . I explained to him that I wasn’t desperate . I was just afraid , which was only natural .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 5 &gt; Page 120 &middot; Location 1311</div><div class='noteText'>He wasn’t even sure he was alive , because he was living like a dead man . Whereas it looked as if I was the one who’d come up emptyhanded . But I was sure about me , about everything , surer than he could ever be , sure of my life and sure of the death I had waiting for me . Yes , that was all I had .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 5 &gt; Page 122 &middot; Location 1331</div><div class='noteText'>For the first time in a long time I thought about Maman . I felt as if I understood why at the end of her life she had taken a “ fiance , ” why she had played at beginning again . Even there , in that home where lives were fading out , evening was a kind of wistful respite . So close to death , Maman must have felt free then and ready to live it all again .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 5 &gt; Page 122 &middot; Location 1334</div><div class='noteText'>I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world . Finding it so much like myself — so like a brother , really — I felt that I had been happy and that I was happy again .</h3>
