<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - WHY PAYING ATTENTION IS SO SUPREMELY IMPORTANT &gt; Page 122 &middot; Location 1785</div><div class='noteText'>In our example of the neck pain , a mis - perception might take the form of an obsessive preoccupation with fleeting sensations in the neck that we might exaggerate into pain , making a mountain out of a molehill , so to speak , leading to hypochondriasis and maybe even wearing a neck brace unnecessarily , while not exercising the neck in ways that could make it stronger and more flexible . We might be walking around identifying with what we tell ourselves is a chronic neck problem , and missing all opportunities for looking more deeply into it . We could call this a form of unwise attention , rooted in a reactive self - preoccupation that keeps us stuck in disconnection of a different order .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - DUKKHA &gt; Page 128 &middot; Location 1858</div><div class='noteText'>cessation of dukkha is the cultivation of mindfulness , an entirely different way of relating to this pervasive condition of dis - ease , one that involves embracing it and being willing to work with it , to observe it without bias in its most intimate characteristics .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - DUKKHA MAGNETS &gt; Page 132 &middot; Location 1914</div><div class='noteText'>Both “ medicine ” and “ meditation ” come from the Latin mederi , which means to cure . However , the deep Indo - European root of mederi carries the core meaning of to measure . This is not our usual notion of measure as an accounting of the quantitative relationship to an established standard for a particular property such as length , volume , or area . Rather , it refers to the Platonic notion that all things have their own right inward measure , the properties or “ isness ” that makes the object what it is . Medicine can be understood as that which restores right inward measure when it is disturbed , and meditation as the direct perception of right inward measure and the deep experiential knowing of its nature .</h3>

The surreal nightmare of losing one’s purpose and orientation ( “ Where am I going this morning , all dressed up for work ? Oh yes . To the office , course , like all these other people on the train . But where do I work , and what is it that actually I do ? ” ) leads all of a sudden to immersion in a dreamlike state in which everything is vaguely familiar and yet not . It rapidly turns into a living nightmare .</h3>

For none of us ever know how long we can count on having these capacities at our disposal , or how long we actually have to continue living and learning and growing into the fullness of ourselves .</h3>

It’s just that your world immediately becomes a lot bigger , and more real . Everything old looks different because it is now being seen in a new light — an awareness that is no longer confined by the conventional dimensionality and mind set .</h3>

It is awareness itself , the knowing capacity of mind itself , beyond a knower and what is known , just knowing .</h3>

Interestingly , the overall brain patterning seen in the lamas was in the same direction and in the same regions of the frontal cortex as the shifts we were observing in our study , although in the case of the lamas , it was quantitatively far stronger . The comparison suggests that regular people beginning meditation — and not just adepts who have undergone years and years of intensive training and practice — in a fairly short period of time , can show changes in the brain and in the body similar to those with far greater training and practice experience , changes that are consistent with a refining of one’s capacity for paying attention and for residing in greater empathic awareness .</h3>

The rest could find out when the retreat was over . That retreat went until mid - December . Under the piece of paper , day after day , the message was always the same inconceivable one : “ We don’t know yet . ” Imagine how confused the meditators were who wanted to know and knew only that nobody did , without any of the story of why !
