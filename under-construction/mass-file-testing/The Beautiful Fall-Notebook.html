Both were the only , cherished sons of prosperous , middle - class families . Their fathers were successful businessmen who provided for their families , aspiring wives and bourgeois lifestyles . Both fathers conducted an entirely courteous and caring , if distant , relationship with their sons , which was perhaps characteristic of their generation . Both boys were homosexual and aware of their sexual orientation from an early age . They loved to sketch and in particular they loved to sketch dresses . They were both boys from the provinces , dreaming of Paris .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 19 &middot; Location 381</div><div class='noteText'>Both the couture house – the outside of which was draped in black – and France were devastated .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 20 &middot; Location 387</div><div class='noteText'>From the very start Dior had employed a business manager , Jacques Rouët , whose job it was to carry out the business offensive while Dior’s aura of divine creativity was preserved intact . This was a business model Yves Saint Laurent would later adopt himself .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 20 &middot; Location 396</div><div class='noteText'>And here was this young man , six foot two and jangling with nerves , looking every inch the first violinist in the school orchestra , being asked to design haute couture for the world’s biggest couture house .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 21 &middot; Location 405</div><div class='noteText'>From now on , twice a year , Yves would hide himself away and sketch one thousand drawings in the space of two frenzied weeks . It was a crazy pace for a young man of his age to work at . From the abundance of these ideas , there would emerge two hundred outfits for the collection .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 21 &middot; Location 414</div><div class='noteText'>The Trapèze was still a classic couture silhouette but was made radical by the way Saint Laurent had removed much of the famous Dior body - padding and construction for the very first time . In previous years a Dior dress could practically stand up on its own , it had so much whale - boning and corseting inside contrived to reshape and enhance the silhouette of the Dior lady ; added to that was the weight of the lining and the thickness of the fabric and padding , which made the dress into a kind of sculpture . Yves made the clothes free - flowing and gave them youth and spirit by literally lightening them up and shortening the hemline</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 22 &middot; Location 430</div><div class='noteText'>Saint Laurent was now the youngest couturier in the world and heir to the kingdom of Dior . How strange , how vertiginous to be aged twenty - one and watch your dreams already rushing to fulfilment , dreams that you are still dreaming .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 23 &middot; Location 437</div><div class='noteText'>le nouvel enfant triste</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 23 &middot; Location 446</div><div class='noteText'>The image conjured up of Yves Saint Laurent was from the very beginning that of victim in victory , of a youth sacrificed for fashion .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 23 &middot; Location 448</div><div class='noteText'>Few people saw the incandescent ambition and violent creativity that was also Yves Saint Laurent .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 26 &middot; Location 477</div><div class='noteText'>When Pierre was a pupil at lycée , aged seventeen , a teacher slapped him . He was so livid that he hung out by the school gates waiting for the teacher the next day , having forewarned all his friends to be there to witness the action . As the teacher rode out on his bike , Pierre grabbed the bicycle and slapped the man twice about his face . The idea of a pupil hitting his teacher in 1947 France is almost inconceivable , in a country where unquestioning obedience before the teacher was , and still is , the rule .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 27 &middot; Location 493</div><div class='noteText'>He was young , up from the provinces and convinced that Buffet was the creative genius he had come to Paris to find . He thought , as he has often said , that he had met his Rimbaud . And so he devoted the next eight years to selling the man and his art .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 28 &middot; Location 514</div><div class='noteText'>‘ Everything I didn’t have , he had , ’ said Yves forty - three years later to explain Bergé’s appeal . ‘ His strength meant I could rest on him when I was out of breath . ’</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 28 &middot; Location 525</div><div class='noteText'>Galey did not hold out against Bergé and the following entries allude to their affair and Galey’s realisation that he is just ‘ an amusing digression in his [ Bergé’s ] busy summer ’ .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 29 &middot; Location 541</div><div class='noteText'>His will was never more evident than in his final collection for the house of Dior , the so - called Beat collection of July 1960 , in which Yves was inspired by Juliette Gréco and the beatnik scene of Saint Germain .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 29 &middot; Location 543</div><div class='noteText'>including a short alligator - skin jacket with fur trim and abbreviated sleeves which had a sporty cut to it , and a long black voluminous coat , called mischievously ‘ le Blouson Noir ’ , the name given to young suburban hoodlums in the late 1950s .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 30 &middot; Location 553</div><div class='noteText'>Christian Dior died the day Marc Bohan was due to take up his post at the house and then weeks later Yves was given the job as designer . But , interestingly , even as Dior management announced Yves Saint Laurent as Dior’s successor , they still kept Bohan under contract in secret , as a back - up plan should things not work out with Yves . They didn’t know what to do with Bohan so they sent him off on an expenses - paid trip to New York in February 1958 , and when he returned at the end of July he was sent to London to design the Dior readyto - wear .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 30 &middot; Location 557</div><div class='noteText'>So close</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 32 &middot; Location 584</div><div class='noteText'>It was while Yves was in hospital in September 1960 that it was made known that he would not be returning to Paris as head designer at Dior .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 33 &middot; Location 606</div><div class='noteText'>The memory of treatment at Val - de - Grâce has tended to obscure the devastating effect that Dior’s abandonment and Yves ’ dramatic fall from the heights of fashion must also have had on him . ‘ Pierre placed so much importance on the Val - de - Grâce episode , ’ says Victoire , ‘ but I lived through it with them and the real reason was that Yves had been at the pinnacle , the petit prince at the house of Dior , and then all of a sudden he was at the Val - de - Grâce and dropped by Dior and pouff , no one cared about him any more . That is hard for someone so young to bear . ’</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 35 &middot; Location 633</div><div class='noteText'>He always , always said there is Yves Saint Laurent and then there are the other designers who come a long way after . And so he constructed this kind of personality of Yves Saint Laurent , rather than leaving him to be merely a talented couturier . Pierre wanted to make an artist of him . He wanted to put him up there on a plane with the great artists and that has been his guiding role from the beginning . ’</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 36 &middot; Location 653</div><div class='noteText'>‘ Sometimes he would have these intense furies . He would wrap a towel tight round his head and shout , “ See , I’ve got no hair left ! ” There was this incredible anger against those who had abandoned him . He was like a child with a profound sense of disillusion , a feeling of having been terribly wronged and not knowing how to exteriorise that . ’</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 36 &middot; Location 657</div><div class='noteText'>Both times Victoire persuaded her husband to photograph and publish the outfits in Paris Match and keep Yves ’ name in the public eye .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 37 &middot; Location 676</div><div class='noteText'>But there was one outfit that stood out and was to become an iconic image in the history of fashion : a navy - blue pea - coat , wide white pants and babouche flat slippers worn by Victoire . It was this ‘ caban ’ or pea - coat in thick felted wool with fat brass buttons , the sort of jacket worn by sailors to keep the Atlantic gales out , which expressed the modernity and force Yves Saint Laurent would bring to fashion .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 39 &middot; Location 707</div><div class='noteText'>quel horreur</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 39 &middot; Location 717</div><div class='noteText'>‘ He would sort of half close his eyes as he listened to you as if you were fascinating . He had unbelievable charm . ’</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 40 &middot; Location 731</div><div class='noteText'>The first half of the 1960s was still a period when manufacturers and department - store buyers paid a fee each season to see the couture shows in order to buy clothes and , most importantly , to get the right to copy them . A plane left from Paris every season loaded up with couture outfits , which were then pulled apart on arrival and copied seam for seam on 7th Avenue .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 41 &middot; Location 741</div><div class='noteText'>‘ The word seduction has replaced the word elegance in fashion , ’ he said . ‘ I don’t like trousers when they are worn as a form of protest , that’s to say , “ I’m the equal of man ” , the George Sand , suffragette kind of way . I think quite the opposite . In wearing trousers a woman can develop the maximum of her femininity in the fight against man . ’</h3>

She possessed not just a sexual freedom , but also a freedom about her body that was almost childlike in its candour . She was emblematic of the upper - class hippie movement that defined 1960s London but which Paris had not experienced in the same way . Yves had never seen anyone like Talitha before .

Neustadt was unprepared for Karl’s levels of sophistication . Kurt Lagerfeld remembered : ‘ Uncle Otto had invited all the farmers and one farmer got talking to Karl and took him to the bar and said , “ Let’s have a drink together , let’s have a beer , ” and Karl replied , “ I only drink champagne . ” Well , the news of that conversation went round the whole town and there was much laughter . That was on the 1 May 1952 and Karl turned nineteen that September . ’ There was already a deliberate bid to disassociate himself publicly from his immediate horizon of beer and pickled herrings . In an interview with Der Stern , Karl himself admitted , ‘ As a child , a very young person , I had the feeling : “ It doesn’t matter what you do – you’re compelling ! ” I thought I was sacrosanct – wasted on dismal postwar Germany .
