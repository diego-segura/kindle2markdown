It’s a kind of elementary mathematics . ” So he started very early to tell me about the world and how interesting it is .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Making of a Scientist &gt; Page 13 &middot; Location 107</div><div class='noteText'>The next Monday , when the fathers were all back at work , we kids were playing in a field . One kid says to me , “ See that bird ? What kind of bird is that ? ” I said , “ I haven’t the slightest idea what kind of a bird it is . ” He says , “ It’s a brown - throated thrush . Your father doesn’t teach you anything ! ” But it was the opposite . He had already taught me : “ See that bird ? ” he says . “ It’s a Spencer’s warbler . ” ( I knew he didn’t know the real name . ) “ Well , in Italian , it’s a Chutto Lapittida . In Portuguese , it’s a Bom da Peida . In Chinese , it’s a Chung - long - tah , and in Japanese , it’s a Katano Tekeda . You can know the name of that bird in all the languages of the world , but when you’re finished , you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird . You’ll only know about humans in different places , and what they call the bird . So let’s look at the bird and see what it’s doing — that’s what counts . ” ( I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something . )</h3>

When I pull the wagon , the ball rolls to the back of the wagon . And when I’m pulling it along and I suddenly stop , the ball rolls to the front of the wagon . Why is that ? ” “ That , nobody knows , ” he said . “ The general principle is that things which are moving tend to keep on moving , and things which are standing still tend to stand still , unless you push them hard . This tendency is called ‘ inertia , ’ but nobody knows why it’s true . ” Now , that’s a deep understanding . He didn’t just give me the name .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Making of a Scientist &gt; Page 18 &middot; Location 174</div><div class='noteText'>One time we were looking at a picture of the pope and everybody bowing in front of him . My father said , “ Now , look at those humans . Here’s one human standing here , and all these others are bowing in front of him . Now , what’s the difference ? This one is the pope ” — he hated the pope anyway . He said , “ This difference is the hat he’s wearing . ” ( If it was a general , it was the epaulets . It was always the costume , the uniform , the position . ) “ But , ” he said , “ this man has the same problems as everybody else : he eats dinner ; he goes to the bathroom . He’s a human being . ” ( By the way , my father was in the uniform business , so he knew what the difference is in a man with the uniform off and the uniform on — it was the same man for him . )</h3>

I felt terrific . The next time I went out on a date — it was with a different girl — I say goodnight to her , and she says , “ Thank you for a very lovely evening . ” I didn’t feel quite so terrific . When I said goodnight to the third girl I took out , she’s got her mouth open , ready to speak , and I say , “ Thank you for a very lovely evening ! ” She says , “ Thank you — uh — Oh ! — Yes — uh , I had a lovely evening , too , thank you ! ”</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - “What Do You Care What Other People Think?” &gt; Page 30 &middot; Location 330</div><div class='noteText'>I got a strip of paper , put a half twist in it , and made it into a loop . Arlene was delighted .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - “What Do You Care What Other People Think?” &gt; Page 31 &middot; Location 349</div><div class='noteText'>I was about to write a simple theme about this dumb question when I remembered that my literary friends were always “ throwing the bull ” — building up their sentences to sound complex and sophisticated . I decided to try it , just for the hell of it . I thought , “ If the Regents are so silly as to have a subject like the importance of science in aviation , I’m gonna do that . ” So I wrote stuff like , “ Aeronautical science is important in the analysis of the eddies , vortices , and whirlpools formed in the atmosphere behind the aircraft … ” — I knew that eddies , vortices , and whirlpools are the same thing , but mentioning them three different ways sounds better ! That was the only thing I would not have ordinarily done on the test . The teacher who corrected my examination must have been impressed by eddies , vortices , and whirlpools , because I got a 91 on the exam — while my literary friends , who chose topics the English teachers could more easily take issue with , both got 88 . That year a new rule came out : if you got 90 or better on a Regents examination , you automatically got honors in that subject at graduation ! So while the playwright and the editor of the school newspaper had to stay in their seats , this illiterate fool physics student was called to go up to the stage once again and receive honors in English !</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - “What Do You Care What Other People Think?” &gt; Page 33 &middot; Location 374</div><div class='noteText'>Arlene and I began to mold each other’s personality . She lived in a family that was very polite , and was very sensitive to other people’s feelings . She taught me to be more sensitive to those kinds of things , too . On the other hand , her family felt that “ white lies ” were okay . I thought one should have the attitude of “ What do you care what other people think ! ” I said , “ We should listen to other people’s opinions and take them into account . Then , if they don’t make sense and we think they’re wrong , then that’s that ! ” Arlene caught on to the idea right away . It was easy to talk her into thinking that in our relationship , we must be very honest with each other and say everything straight , with absolute frankness . It worked very well , and we became very much in love — a love like no other love that I know of .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - “What Do You Care What Other People Think?” &gt; Page 43 &middot; Location 513</div><div class='noteText'>The bookkeeper says to me , “ You’re married now . You should kiss the bride ! ” So the bashful character kissed his bride lightly on the cheek .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - “What Do You Care What Other People Think?” &gt; Page 44 &middot; Location 524</div><div class='noteText'>In those days we didn’t have extra stuff , so I didn’t want to waste the pencils . I got a razor blade from the bathroom and cut off the writing on one of them to see if I could use them . The next morning , I get a letter in the mail . It starts out , “ WHAT’S THE IDEA OF TRYING TO CUT THE NAME OFF THE PENCILS ? ” It continues : “ Aren’t you proud of the fact that I love you ? ” Then : “ WHAT DO YOU CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK ? ” Then came poetry : “ If you’re ashamed of me , dah dah , then Pecans to you ! Pecans to you ! ” The next verse was the same kind of stuff , with the last line , “ Almonds to you ! Almonds to you ! ” Each one was “ Nuts to you ! ” in a different form . So I had to use the pencils with the names on them . What else could I do ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - “What Do You Care What Other People Think?” &gt; Page 45 &middot; Location 548</div><div class='noteText'>I write , “ Look : you’re way out of scale ! ” Soon another catalog comes : it’s for various kinds of motor boats — Chriscraft this and that . I write , “ Too expensive ! ” Finally , I get a note : “ This is your last chance , Richard . You’re always saying no . ” It turns out a friend of hers has a rowboat she wants to sell for $ 15 — a used rowboat — and maybe we could buy it so we could row around in the water next summer . So , yes . I mean , how can you say no after all that ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - “What Do You Care What Other People Think?” &gt; Page 46 &middot; Location 560</div><div class='noteText'>I can’t just go out there and start cookin ’ steaks on the lawn ! ” “ What do you care what other people think ? ” ( Arlene tortured me with that ! )</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - “What Do You Care What Other People Think?” &gt; Page 48 &middot; Location 586</div><div class='noteText'>I learned what she meant . There’s a particular way you have to make the stroke for it to look good . An aesthetic thing has a certain set , a certain character , which I can’t define . Because it couldn’t be defined made me think there was nothing to it .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - “What Do You Care What Other People Think?” &gt; Page 50 &middot; Location 605</div><div class='noteText'>“ Elder brother also speaks . ” I’m a real bastard — I would never let my little sister score one on me .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - “What Do You Care What Other People Think?” &gt; Page 51 &middot; Location 623</div><div class='noteText'>It’s hard to explain . If a Martian ( who , we’ll imagine , never dies except by accident ) came to Earth and saw this peculiar race of creatures — these humans who live about seventy or eighty years , knowing that death is going to come — it would look to him like a terrible problem of psychology to live under those circumstances , knowing that life is only temporary . Well , we humans somehow figure out how to live despite this problem : we laugh , we joke , we live . The only difference for me and Arlene was ; instead of fifty years , it was five years . It was only a quantitative difference — the psychological problem was just the same . The only way it would have become any different is if we had said to ourselves , “ But those other people have it better , because they might live fifty years . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - “What Do You Care What Other People Think?” &gt; Page 53 &middot; Location 650</div><div class='noteText'>One night I had a dream , and Arlene came into it . Right away , I said to her , “ No , no , you can’t be in this dream . You’re not alive ! ” Then later , I had another dream with Arlene in it . I started in again , saying , “ You can’t be in this dream ! ” “ No , no , ” she says . “ I fooled you . I was tired of you , so I cooked up this ruse so I could go my own way . But now I like you again , so I’ve come back . ” My mind was really working against itself . It had to be explained , even in a goddamn dream , why it was possible that she was still there ! I must have done something to myself , psychologically . I didn’t cry until about a month later , when I was walking past a department store in Oak Ridge and noticed a pretty dress in the window . I thought , “ Arlene would like that , ” and then it hit me .</h3>

Now , tell me : how did you describe it when you were talking to yourself ? ” So I learned from Bernie that thoughts can be visual as well as verbal .</h3>

It turned out that Tukey was counting in a different way : he was visualizing a tape with numbers on it going by . He would say , “ Mary had a little lamb , ” and he would watch it ! Well , now it was clear : he’s “ looking ” at his tape going by , so he can’t read , and I’m “ talking ” to myself when I’m counting , so I can’t speak !</h3>

They were concerned that if two rocket sections scrape as they’re being put together , metal filings could get into the rubber seals and damage them . They even had some suggestions for redesigning the seal . Those suggestions weren’t very good , but the point is , the workers were thinking ! I got the impression that they were not undisciplined ; they were very interested in what they were doing , but they weren’t being given much encouragement . Nobody was paying much attention to them . It was remarkable that their morale was as high as it was under the circumstances .</h3>

Mr . Lamberth’s admonishment went down through the levels until somebody in middle management realized that Mr . Fichtel had gone by the book , and that the error was in the manual . But instead of telling Mr . Lamberth about the error , they simply threw away the admonishment , and just kept quiet .</h3>

It’s not a question of what has been written down , or who should tell what to whom ; it’s a question of whether , when you do tell somebody about some problem , they’re delighted to hear about it and they say “ Tell me more ” and “ Have you tried such - and - such ? ” or they say “ Well , see what you can do about it ” — which is a completely different atmosphere . If you try once or twice to communicate and get pushed back , pretty soon you decide , “ To hell with it . ”</h3>

You don’t have to tell me there’s a baby on board ; I’m gonna drive carefully anyway ! What am I supposed to do when I see there’s a baby on board : act differently ? As if I’m suddenly gonna drive more carefully and not hit the car because there’s a baby on board , when all I’m trying to do is not hit it anyway ! So NASA was trying to get the shuttle up anyway : you don’t have to say there’s a baby on board , or there’s a teacher on board , or it’s important to get this one up for the President .</h3>
