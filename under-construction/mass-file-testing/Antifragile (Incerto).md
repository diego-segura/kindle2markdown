> According to legend, Mithridates IV, king of Pontus in Asia Minor, while hiding after his father’s assassination, got himself some protection against poisoning by ingesting sub- lethal doses of toxic material in progressively larger quantities. He later incorporated the process into a complicated religious ritual. But this immunity got him in trouble a bit later as his attempt to take his own life by poisoning failed, “having fortified himself against the drugs of others. ” So he had to ask for the services of an ally military commander to give him a blow with a sword.

—

Location 1008

> It is that political movements and rebellions can be highly antifragile, and the sucker game is to try to repress them using brute force rather than manipulate them, give in, or find more astute ruses, as Heracles did with Hydra.

—

Location 1012

> Literature is rife with characters trapped in a form of antifragile passion, seemingly against their will. In Proust’s long novel La recherche, Swann, a socially sophisticated Jewish art dealer, falls for Odette, a demimondaine, a “kept ” woman of sorts, a semi- or perhaps just a quarter- prostitute; she treats him badly. Her elusive behavior fuels his obsession, causing him to demean himself for the reward of a bit more time with her.

—

Location 1017

> Or take Dino Buzzati’s semiautobiographical novel Un amore, the story of a middle- aged Milanese man who falls— accidentally, of course— for a dancer at the Scala who moonlights as a prostitute. She of course mistreats him, exploits him, takes advantage of him, milks him; and the more she mistreats him, the more he exposes himself to abuse to satisfy the antifragile thirst of a few moments with her.

> Psychologists have shown the irony of the process of thought control: the more energy you put into trying to control your ideas and what you think about, the more your ideas end up controlling you.

—

Location 1030

> The wily Venetians knew how to spread information by disguising it as a secret. Try it out with the following experiment in spreading gossip: tell someone a secret and qualify it by insisting that it is a secret, begging your listener “not to tell anyone ”; the more you insist that it remain a secret, the more it will spread.

—

Location 1055

> There is a visible selection bias: why did he attack you instead of someone else, one of the millions of persons deserving but not worthy of attack? It is his energy in attacking or badmouthing that will, antifragile style, put you on the map.

—

Location 1059

> As my grandfather, his eldest son, was starting his administrative and hopefully political career, his father summoned him to his deathbed. “My son, I am very disappointed in you, ” he said. “I never hear anything wrong said about you. You have proven yourself incapable of generating envy. ”

—

Location 1088

> When you don’t have debt you don’t care about your reputation in economics circles— and somehow it is only when you don’t care about your reputation that you tend to have a good one. Just as in matters of seduction, people lend the most to those who need them the least.

—

Location 1093

> It is quite perplexing that those from whom we have benefited the most aren’t those who have tried to help us ( say with “advice ” ) but rather those who have actively tried— but eventually failed— to harm us.

Location 1191

> For an idea of how harmful a low- level stressor without recovery can be, consider the so- called Chinese water torture: a drop continuously hitting the same spot on your head, never letting you recover. Indeed, the way Heracles managed to control Hydra was by cauterizing the wounds on the stumps of the heads that he had just severed. He thus prevented the regrowth of the heads and the exercise of antifragility. In other words, he disrupted the recovery.

> I feel anger and frustration when I think that one in ten Americans beyond the age of high school is on some kind of antidepressant, such as Prozac. Indeed, when you go through mood swings, you now have to justify why you are not on some medication. There may be a few good reasons to be on medication, in severely pathological cases, but my mood, my sadness, my bouts of anxiety, are a second source of intelligence— perhaps even the first source. I get mellow and lose physical energy when it rains, become more meditative, and tend to write more and more slowly then, with the raindrops hitting the window, what Verlaine called autumnal “sobs ” ( sanglots ). Some days I enter poetic melancholic states, what the Portuguese call saudade or the Turks hüzün ( from the Arabic word for sadness ). Other days I am more aggressive, have more energy— and will write less, walk more, do other things, argue with researchers, answer emails, draw graphs on blackboards. Should I be turned into a vegetable or a happy imbecile?

> CHAPTER 4 ￼ What Kills Me Makes Others Stronger Antifragility for one is fragility for someone else— Where we introduce the idea that we think too much, do very little— Fail for others to succeed— One day you may get a thank- you note

—

Location 1329

> This other variety of antifragility is evolutionary, and operates at the informational level— genes are information. Unlike with hormesis, the unit does not get stronger in response to stress; it dies. But it accomplishes a transfer of benefits; other units survive— and those that survive have attributes that improve the collective of units, leading to modifications commonly assigned the vague term “evolution ”

> A tree has many branches, and these look like small trees; further, these large branches have many more smaller branches that sort of look like even smaller trees. This is a manifestation of what is called fractal self- similarity, a vision by the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot.

> epistemic

—

Location 1455

> Further, my characterization of a loser is someone who, after making a mistake, doesn’t introspect, doesn’t exploit it, feels embarrassed and defensive rather than enriched with a new piece of information, and tries to explain why he made the mistake rather than moving on. These types often consider themselves the “victims ” of some large plot, a bad boss, or bad weather.

—

Location 1492

> Nietzsche’s famous expression “what does not kill me makes me stronger ” can be easily misinterpreted as meaning Mithridatization or hormesis. It may be one of these two phenomena, very possible, but it could as well mean “what did not kill me did not make me stronger, but spared me because I am stronger than others; but it killed others and the average population is now stronger because the weak are gone. ” In other words, I passed an exit exam.

Location 1586

> As in Baudelaire’s sad poem about the albatross, what is made to fly will not do well trapped on the ground, where it is forced to traipse. And it is quite fitting that “volatility ” comes from volare, “to fly ” in Latin. Depriving political ( and other ) systems of volatility harms them, causing eventually greater volatility of the cascading type.

> CHAPTER 5 ￼ The Souk and the Office Building The Reds and the Whites all go to Zurich— War is not a prison— The turkey’s thwarted projects— Remember we are in Extremistan

—

Location 1621

> Artisans, say, taxi drivers, prostitutes ( a very, very old profession ), carpenters, plumbers, tailors, and dentists, have some volatility in their income but they are rather robust to a minor professional Black Swan, one that would bring their income to a complete halt. Their risks are visible. Not so with employees, who have no volatility, but can be surprised to see their income going to zero after a phone call from the personnel department. Employees ’ risks are hidden.

—

Location 1640

> Further, for a self- employed person, a small ( nonterminal ) mistake is information, valuable information, one that directs him in his adaptive approach; for someone employed like John, a mistake is something that goes into his permanent record, filed in the personnel department. Yogi Berra once said: “We made the wrong mistake ”

—

Location 1646

> The centralized state resembles the income of John; the city- state model that of George. John has one large employer, George many small ones— so he can select the ones that fit him the best and hence has, at any point in time, “more options. ” One has the illusion of stability, but is fragile; the other one the illusion of variability, but is robust and even antifragile. The more variability you observe in a system, the less Black Swan– prone it is.

—

Location 1690

> Switzerland acts as a magnet for the ugly rich and tax refugees. Note for now that this is the last major country that is not a nation- state, but rather a collection of small municipalities left to their own devices.

—

Location 1705

> Further, biology plays a role in a municipal environment, not in a larger system. An administration is shielded from having to feel the sting of shame ( with flushing in his face ), a biological reaction to overspending and other failures such as killing people in Vietnam. Eye contact with one’s peers changes one’s behavior. But for a desk- grounded office leech, a number is just a number. Someone you see in church Sunday morning would feel uncomfortable for his mistakes— and more responsible for them. On the small, local scale, his body and biological response would direct him to avoid causing harm to others.

—

Location 1712

> “Stalin could not have existed in a municipality. ”

—

Location 1732

> Note another element of Switzerland: it is perhaps the most successful country in history, yet it has traditionally had a very low level of university education compared to the rest of the rich nations. Its system, even in banking during my days, was based on apprenticeship models, nearly vocational rather than the theoretical ones. In other words, on techne ( crafts and know how ), not episteme ( book knowledge, know what ).

> Nor did the point escape Machiavelli. Jean- Jacques Rousseau wrote, citing him: “It seemed, wrote Machiavelli, that in the midst of murders and civil wars, our republic became stronger [ and ] its citizens infused with virtues. … A little bit of agitation gives resources to souls and what makes the species prosper isn’t peace, but freedom. ”

Location 1864

> Some people have fallen for the naive turkey- style belief that the world is getting safer and safer, and of course they naively attribute it to the holy “state ” ( though bottom- up Switzerland has about the lowest rate of violence of any place on the planet ). It is exactly like saying that nuclear bombs are safer because they explode less often.

> Variations also act as purges. Small forest fires periodically cleanse the system of the most flammable material, so this does not have the opportunity to accumulate. Systematically preventing forest fires from taking place “to be safe ” makes the big one much worse.

—

Location 1936

> Let us now look at the situation in which adding randomness has been a standard operating method, as the needed fuel for an antifragile system permanently hungry for it. A donkey equally famished and thirsty caught at an equal distance between food and water would unavoidably die of hunger or thirst. But he can be saved thanks to a random nudge one way or the other. This metaphor is named Buridan’s Donkey,

Location 1974

> For Voltaire, the best form of government was the one tempered with political assassination. Regicide is sort of the equivalent of tapping on the barometer to make it work better. That, too, creates some often- needed reshuffling, and one that would never have been done voluntarily. The void created at the top allows the annealing effect, causing the new leader to emerge.

—

Location 1982

> Finally the ancients perfected the method of random draw in more or less difficult situations— and integrated it into divinations. These draws were really meant to pick a random exit without having to make a decision, so one would not have to live with the burden of the consequences later. You went with what the gods told you to do, so you would not have to second- guess yourself later. One of the methods, called sortes virgilianae ( fate as decided by the epic poet Virgil ), involved opening Virgil’s Aeneid at random and interpreting the line that presented itself as direction for the course of action. You should use such method for every sticky business decision.

The remaining 215 children were again presented to doctors, and 99 were said to need the surgery. When the remaining 116 children were shown to yet a third set of doctors, 52 were recommended the surgery.

Semmelweis entered a state of depression, helpless to stop what he saw as murders, disgusted at the attitude of the establishment. He ended up in an asylum, where he died, ironically, from the same hospital fever he had been warning against.

Location 2141

> In the Mel Brooks movie The Producers, two New York theater fellows get in trouble by finding success instead of the intended failure. They had sold the same shares to multiple investors in a Broadway play, reasoning that should the play fail, they would keep the excess funds— their scheme would not be discovered if the investors got no return on their money. The problem was that they tried so hard to have a bad play— called Springtime for Hitler— and they were so bad at it that it turned out to be a huge hit.

—

Location 2146

> I also saw similar irony in trading: a fellow was so upset with his year- end bonus that he started making huge bets with his employer’s portfolio— and ended up making them considerable sums of money, more than if he had tried to do so on purpose.

—

Location 2148

> Perhaps the idea behind capitalism is an inverse- iatrogenic effect, the unintended- but- not- so- unintended consequences: the system facilitates the conversion of selfish aims ( or, to be correct, not necessarily benevolent ones ) at the individual level into beneficial results for the collective.

> For a sample of a composed, calm, and pondered voice, listen to interviews with “Sammy the Bull, ” Salvatore Gravano, who was involved in the murder of nineteen people ( all competing mobsters ). He speaks with minimal effort, as if what he is discussing is “not a big deal. ” This second type sometimes reacts when necessary; in the rare situations when he is angry, unlike with the neurotic fellow, everyone knows it and takes it seriously.

—

Location 2329

> If you want to accelerate someone’s death, give him a personal doctor. I don’t mean provide him with a bad doctor: just pay for him to choose his own. Any doctor will do. This may be the only possible way to murder someone while staying squarely within the law. We can see from the tonsillectomy story that access to data increases intervention, causing us to behave like the neurotic fellow.

They discovered that famine was more severe in areas with higher food production in the period before the famine began, meaning that it was government policy of food distribution that was behind much of the problem, owing to the inflexibility in the procurement system.

> When constrained systems, those hungry for natural disorder, collapse, as they are eventually bound to, since they are fragile, failure is never seen as the result of fragility. Rather, such failure is interpreted as the product of poor forecasting. As with a crumbling sand pile, it would be unintelligent to attribute the collapse of a fragile bridge to the last truck that crossed it, and even more foolish to try to predict in advance which truck might bring it down. Yet it is done all too often.

—

Location 2511

> Since detecting ( anti ) fragility— or, actually, smelling it, as Fat Tony will show us in the next few chapters— is easier, much easier, than prediction and understanding the dynamics of events, the entire mission reduces to the central principle of what to do to minimize harm ( and maximize gain ) from forecasting errors, that is, to have things that don’t fall apart, or even benefit, when we make a mistake.

> people in the nuclear industry seem to be among the rare ones to have gotten the point and taken it to its logical consequence. In the wake of the Fukushima disaster, instead of predicting failure and the probabilities of disaster, these intelligent nuclear firms are now aware that they should instead focus on exposure to failure— making the prediction or nonprediction of failure quite irrelevant. This approach leads to building small enough reactors and embedding them deep enough in the ground with enough layers of protection around them that a failure would not affect us much should it happen— costly, but still better than nothing.

> Fat Tony believed that nerds, administrators, and, mostly, bankers were the ultimate suckers ( that was when everyone still thought they were geniuses ). And, what’s more, he believed that collectively they were even bigger suckers than they were individually. And he had a natural ability to detect these suckers before they fell apart. Fat Tony derived his income from that activity while leading, as we saw, a life of leisure. Nero’s interests were similar to Tony’s, except dressed up in intellectual traditions. To Nero, a system built on illusions of understanding probability is bound to collapse. By betting against fragility, they were antifragile

> So just as, for a plane that has a high risk of crashing, the notion of “speed ” is irrelevant, since we know it may not get to its destination, economic growth with fragilities is not to be called growth, something that has not yet been understood by governments. Indeed, growth was very modest, less than 1 percent per head, throughout the golden years surrounding the Industrial Revolution, the period that propelled Europe into domination. But as low as it was, it was robust growth— unlike the current fools ’ race of states shooting for growth like teenage drivers infatuated with speed.

—

Location 2922

> We see evidence of such a strategy with the so- called monogamous birds: they enjoy cheating, with more than a tenth of the broods coming from males other than the putative father. The phenomenon is real, but the theories around it vary. Evolutionary theorists claim that females want both economic- social stability and good genes for their children. Both cannot be always obtained from someone in the middle with all these virtues ( though good gene providers, those alpha males aren’t likely to be stable, and vice versa ). Why not have the pie and eat it too? Stable life and good genes. But an alternative theory may be that they just want to have pleasure— or stable life and good fun.

The strength of the computer entrepreneur Steve Jobs was precisely in distrusting market research and focus groups— those based on asking people what they want— and following his own imagination. His modus was that people don’t know what they want until you provide them with it.

—

Location 3065

> Thales was a philosopher, a Greek- speaking Ionian of Phoenician stock from the coastal town of Miletus in Asia Minor, and like some philosophers, he enjoyed what he was doing. Miletus was a trading post and had the mercantile spirit usually attributed to Phoenician settlements. But Thales, as a philosopher, was characteristically impecunious. He got tired of his buddies with more transactional lives hinting at him that “those who can, do, and others philosophize. ” He performed the following prowess: he put a down payment on the seasonal use of every olive press in the vicinity of Miletus and Chios, which he got at low rent. The harvest turned out to be extremely bountiful and there was demand for olive presses, so he released the owners of olive presses on his own terms, building a substantial fortune in the process. Then he went back to philosophizing.

Authors, artists, and even philosophers are much better off having a very small number of fanatics behind them than a large number of people who appreciate their work. The number of persons who dislike the work don’t count— there is no such thing as the opposite of buying your book, or the equivalent of losing points in a soccer game, and this absence of negative domain for book sales provides the author with a measure of optionality.

> And one needs to be rational in not making trial and error completely random. If you are looking for your misplaced wallet in your living room, in a trial and error mode, you exercise rationality by not looking in the same place twice. In many pursuits, every trial, every failure provides additional information, each more valuable than the previous one— if you know what does not work, or where the wallet is not located. With every trial one gets closer to something, assuming an environment in which one knows exactly what one is looking for.

Wonderful confirmation! They rush to the department of ornithology to write books, articles, and reports stating that the bird has obeyed them, an impeccable causal inference. The Harvard Department of Ornithology is now indispensable for bird flying. It will get government research funds for its contribution.

At the same time, Korea had a much lower literacy rate than Argentina ( which had one of the highest in the world ) and about one- fifth the income per person; today it has three times as much. Further, over the same period, sub- Saharan Africa saw markedly increasing literacy rates, accompanied with a decrease in their standard of living. We can multiply the examples ( Pritchet’s study is quite thorough ), but I wonder why people don’t realize the simple truism, that is, the fooled by randomness effect: mistaking the merely associative for the causal, that is, if rich countries are educated, immediately inferring that education makes a country rich, without even checking.

But a short conversation with him revealed that he could not place Switzerland on the map— foolish as I was, I thought he was Swiss Italian, yet he did not know there were Italian- speaking people in Switzerland. He had never been there. When I saw that he was not the exception, I started freaking out watching all these years of education evaporating in front of my eyes. That very same day I stopped reading economic reports. I felt nauseous for a while during this enterprise of “deintellectualization ”— in fact I may not have recovered yet.

Rubinstein is one of the leaders in the field of game theory, which consists in thought experiments; he is also the greatest expert in cafés for thinking and writing across the planet. Rubinstein refuses to claim that his knowledge of theoretical matters can be translated— by him— into anything directly practical. To him, economics is like a fable— a fable writer is there to stimulate ideas, indirectly inspire practice perhaps, but certainly not to direct or determine practice. Theory should stay independent from practice and vice versa— and we should not extract academic economists from their campuses and put them in positions of decision making. Economics is not a science and should not be there to advise policy.
