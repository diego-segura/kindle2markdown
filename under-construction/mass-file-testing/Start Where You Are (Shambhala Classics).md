That’s a big contrast to actually uncovering the whisper, realizing that it’s passing memory, and moving closer to all those fears and all those edgy feelings that maybe you’re not okay. Well, no big deal. None of us is okay and all of us are fine. It’s not just one way.

> “In postmeditation, be a child of illusion. ”

—

Page 24 - Location 453

> Being a child of illusion also has to do with beginning to encourage yourself not to be a walking battleground. We have such strong feelings of good and evil, right and wrong. We also feel that parts of ourselves are bad or evil and parts of ourselves are good and wholesome. All these pairs of opposites— happy and sad, victory and defeat, loss and gain— are at war with each other. The truth is that good and bad coexist; sour and sweet coexist. They aren’t really opposed to each other. We could start to open our eyes and our hearts to that deep way of perceiving, like moving into a whole new dimension of experience: becoming a child of illusion.

> When Ishi was first taken to San Francisco, he went to the Oroville train station and stood on the platform. When the train came in, without anyone really noticing, he simply walked away very quietly and stood behind a pillar. Then the others noticed and beckoned to him, and they all got on the train to San Francisco. Later, Ishi told Kroeber that for his whole life when he and the other members of his tribe had seen that train they had thought it was a demon that ate people, because of how it snaked along and bellowed smoke and fire. When Kroeber heard that, he was awestruck. He asked, “How did you have the courage to just get on the train if you thought it was a demon? ” Then Ishi said, quite simply, “Well, my life has taught me to be more curious than afraid. ” His life had taught him what it meant to be a child of illusion.

# 5. Poison as Medicine
Page 28 - Location 510

> “Three objects, three poisons, and three seeds of virtue ”

—

Page 30 - Location 539

> The three poisons are always trapping you in one way or another, imprisoning you and making your world really small. When you feel craving, you could be sitting on the edge of the Grand Canyon, but all you can see is this piece of chocolate cake that you’re craving. With aversion, you’re sitting on the edge of the Grand Canyon, and all you can hear is the angry words you said to someone ten years ago. With ignorance, you’re sitting on the edge of the Grand Canyon with a paper bag over your head. Each of the three poisons has the power to capture you so completely that you don’t even perceive what’s in front of you.

> What we’re working with in our basic shamatha- vipashyana practice— and explicitly with the tonglen practice— is the middle ground between acting out and repressing. We’re discovering how to hold our seat and feel completely what’s underneath all that story line of wanting, not wanting, and so forth.

> At that point, all of them left except one. Milarepa said, “Oh, this one is particularly vicious. ” ( We all know that one. Sometimes we have lots of them like that. Sometimes we feel that’s all we’ve got. ) He didn’t know what to do, so he surrendered himself even further. He walked over and put himself right into the mouth of the demon and said, “Just eat me up if you want to. ” Then that demon left too. The moral of the story is, when the resistance is gone, so are the demons.

> At that point, simultaneously, it is no longer your own particular burden; it is just the rage of sentient beings, which includes you. You breathe that in, and you breathe out a sense of ventilation, so that all sentient beings could experience that.

> “When the world is filled with evil, / Transform all mishaps into the path of bodhi. ” The word bodhi means “enlightenment. ”

—

Page 45 - Location 770

> This is tricky business. What’s the difference between seeing that harm has been done and blaming? Perhaps it is that rather than point the finger of blame, we raise questions: “How can I communicate? How can I help the harm that has been done unravel itself? How can I help others find their own wisdom, kindness, and sense of humor? ” That’s a much greater challenge than blaming and hating and acting out.

—

Page 48 - Location 816

> Now you begin to relate with those feelings. You develop some compassion, connecting with the soft spot. You relate with what begins to happen when you’re not protecting yourself so much. Then gradually, like Ishi, you become more curious than afraid. To be fearless isn’t really to overcome fear, it’s to come to know its nature.

> This sudden unreasonableness that comes out of nowhere is called a dön. It wakes you up, and you should regard that as best, rather than try to get rid of the problem. So, on the outer level, you give the dön a cake. On the inner level, you see that a dön has risen, that it has all this force, but you refrain from blackening anybody’s eyes, from acting it out, and you also refrain from repressing it. You take the middle way yet again and let yourself be there with the full force of the dön. Being there has the power to purify you. That’s a description of 100 percent mindfulness

> There’s a Zen story in which a man is enjoying himself on a river at dusk. He sees another boat coming down the river toward him. At first it seems so nice to him that someone else is also enjoying the river on a nice summer evening. Then he realizes that the boat is coming right toward him, faster and faster. He begins to get upset and starts to yell, “Hey, hey, watch out! For Pete’s sake, turn aside! ” But the boat just comes faster and faster, right toward him. By this time he’s standing up in his boat, screaming and shaking his fist, and then the boat smashes right into him. He sees that it’s an empty boat. This is the classic story of our whole life situation. There are a lot of empty boats out there that we’re always screaming at and shaking our fists at. Instead, we could let them stop our minds. Even if they only stop our mind for one point one seconds, we can rest in that little gap. When the story line starts, we can do the tonglen practice of exchanging ourselves for others. In this way everything we meet has the potential to help us cultivate compassion and reconnect with the spacious, open quality of our minds.

Do you want to shut down and close off, do you want to stay imprisoned? Or do you want to let yourself relax here, let yourself die? Here’s your chance to actually realize something. Here’s your chance not to be stuck. So what do you really want? Do you want always to be right or do you want to wake up? ”

I wanted to be a wildflower! ” The caption reads, “Oscar is born again as a head of iceberg lettuce in order to overcome his fear of being eaten. ” One can think from a bigger perspective than this whole notion of reward and punishment. You could see your life as an adult education course. Some of the curriculum you like and some you don’t like; some of what comes up you find workable, some you don’t. That’s the curriculum for attaining enlightenment. The question is, how do you work with it?

I would find myself in various states of mind and various moods, going up and down, going left and right, falling on my face and sitting up— just in all these different life situations— and I would remember, “Buddha falling flat on her face; buddha feeling on top of the world; buddha longing for yesterday. ” I began to learn that I couldn’t get away from buddha no matter how hard I tried. I could stick with myself through thick and thin. If one would enter into an unconditional relationship with oneself, one would be entering into an unconditional relationship with buddha.

However, the more people make friends with themselves, the more they find it a nurturing and supportive place where you can find out the buddhaness of your own self as you are right now, today. Right now today, could you make an unconditional relationship with yourself? Just at the height you are, the weight you are, the amount of intelligence that you have, the burden of pain that you have? Could you enter into an unconditional relationship with that?

# 20. The Big Squeeze
Page 124 - Location 1944

> But if we wish to communicate, if we really wish to open our hearts, sooner or later we are going to find ourselves in the big squeeze, where we can’t buy it and we can’t throw it out, and we are caught in the juicy situation of being big and small at the same time.

> A hermit well known for his austerity had been practicing in a cave for twenty years. An unconventional teacher named Patrul Rinpoche showed up at the cave, and the hermit humbly and sweetly welcomed him in. Patrul Rinpoche said, “Tell me, what have you been doing here? ” “I’ve been practicing the perfection of patience, ” the hermit answered. Putting his face very close to the hermit’s face, Patrul Rinpoche said, “But a pair of old scoundrels like us, we don’t care anything about patience really. We only do this to get everyone’s admiration, right? We just do this to get people to think we are big shots, don’t we? ” And the hermit started getting irritated. But Patrul Rinpoche wouldn’t stop. He just kept laughing and patting him on the back and saying, “Yeah, we sure know how to dupe people, don’t we? We really know. I’ll bet they bring you a lot of gifts, don’t they? ” At this point the hermit stood up and screamed, “Why did you come here? Why are you tormenting me? Go away and leave me in peace! ” And then the Rinpoche said, “So now, where is your perfection of patience? ” So that’s the point. We can create the ideal situation in which we have a very high opinion of ourselves, but how do we do when it comes to the big squeeze?

> “Train in the three difficulties ” is my favorite slogan because it acknowledges that this path is difficult, all right, but it’s a good way to spend our time. There are three difficulties.

> Do something different, such as tonglen. Anything different would help, anything that’s not habitual. For example, you could go up and take a cold shower and sing at the top of your lungs, or drink a glass of water from the wrong side, like you do when you are trying to get rid of hiccups.

> It’s more that the spiritual friend is the ultimate Juan. All your blind spots are going to come out with the spiritual friend. The only difference between the spiritual friend and everybody else in your life is that you’ve made a commitment to stick with him or her through thick or thin, better or worse, richer or poorer, in sickness and in death.

—

Page 136 - Location 2149

> When you’re with the spiritual friend or even thinking about him or her, you begin to see neurosis as neurosis. That encourages you to practice the second difficulty, which is to begin to apply the teachings. And finally, you long to make that a way of life. The spiritual friend does not confirm your existence but serves as a mirror for you to see where you’re stuck. The relationship encourages you to wake up.

The bodhisattva vow is highstakes practice because it’s about giving up privacy and the comfort orientation altogether as a way of awakening your heart further to yourself and to all sentient beings.

He was complaining about his girlfriend, who was having a hard time giving up smoking; the anxiety was triggering an old eating disorder. The young man said he just kept telling her to be strong, not to be so fearful, to be disciplined. And she would tell him, “I’m trying. I’m really trying. I’m doing the best I can. ” He was angry because it didn’t seem to him that she was trying. He said, “I know I shouldn’t be getting so angry about this. I know I should be more compassionate. But I just can’t help it. It gets under my skin. I want to be more understanding, but she’s so stuck. ” Then he heard himself say, “I’m trying. I’m really trying. I’m doing the best I can. ” When he heard himself saying her words, he got the message. He understood what she was up against, and it humbled him.
