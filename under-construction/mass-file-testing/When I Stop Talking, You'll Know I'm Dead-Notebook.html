Weintraub, Jerry

<h2 class='sectionHeading'>The Star of Ardaban</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 8 &middot; Location 134</div><div class='noteText'>No . I can’t write a novel . I can’t write a play . I can’t write a song . But I can help the artist get that book or song or play noticed by the public . And that’s packaging . When you dig through all the craziness of my life , you’ll see that I’m just a guy from the Bronx who knows how to attract a crowd . I can get people to notice the sapphire , so it’s not lying in a cellar where it might be found in a hundred years , long after the man who mined it has died .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>The Red Jacket</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 18 &middot; Location 255</div><div class='noteText'>But I had done a stupid thing . It did not take me long to realize my mistake . No matter how many packages I carried up the stairs , the tip stayed the same . There must be a business - school term for this : I was competing against myself , driving down my own prices . I figured out a solution . I would carry everything up in one trip , but hide the washing under the landing . First I would deliver just the dry cleaning , then loop back later to deliver the laundry . This way , I got two dimes instead of one .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 19 &middot; Location 264</div><div class='noteText'>today : People will pay you to make their lives easier ; always take the time to make the pitch ; personal service is the name of the game ; never get paid once for doing something twice .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Everything but the Girl</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 26 &middot; Location 341</div><div class='noteText'>Now , as I said , every few days , another crew of guys shipped in from the Aleutian Islands , picked up their checks , and went on a spree . So when these guys , chilled to the bone , holding their cash , came into the street , what’s the first thing they saw ? The Sachs Men’s Shop . I decided to tell a story , to package a fantasy right in the big front window . I made a beach scene there , with a guy in a bathing suit sitting beside a gorgeous girl , drinking rum under an umbrella as waves break . The men stood there , mesmerized . Then they came in and talked to me . I took some of their money and in return set them up with a whole package , the plane tickets , the Florida hotel , the clothes , the beach stuff — everything but the girl . It was the Star of Ardaban all over again .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Because I Wouldn’t Wear Tights</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 29 &middot; Location 354</div><div class='noteText'>But time passes , and you change , and as you change , everything else changes , too , so when you return you realize there is no home to return to . It’s gone . When you stood at the train station , waving good - bye , you did not understand what you were waving good - bye to — the world of your childhood dissolved behind you .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 32 &middot; Location 386</div><div class='noteText'>Neighborhood Playhouse School instead . This was one of the acting schools that taught the Method pioneered by Konstantin Stanislavsky , wherein you don’t pretend to be a character so much as become that character .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 33 &middot; Location 408</div><div class='noteText'>I learned things at the Playhouse School that have been invaluable . About actors and artists for one , what drives them , what terrifies them ( this is often the same as what drives them ) , what they need . ( Managing talent is my business , after all . ) These are people who do not make a product , perform an essential service , or , as my father would say , have an inventory , so even the most successful of them are haunted by the following thought : “ Who really needs what I’m making ? ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 34 &middot; Location 420</div><div class='noteText'>I learned a lot from the improv exercises , too . For me , this was less a matter of becoming another person or character than learning to trust the logic of my own mind . Sometimes , when you’re up against it , maybe this is an old Bronx thing , you just have to open your mouth and start talking . I can’t tell you how many jams I’ve gotten out of by talking , seeing where the words take me . “ What are we going to do about it ? ” “ Well , I’ll tell you what we’re going to do about it … ” And I open my mouth and see what happens . That’s improv .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Stay Off the WATS Line</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 39 &middot; Location 470</div><div class='noteText'>Grunt jobs are often the most instructive — they allow you to flow through an organization unnoticed , a corpuscle or cell moving in and out of the heart and lungs .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Being P. T. Barnum</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 56 &middot; Location 674</div><div class='noteText'>Grotto Azura , one of the oldest restaurants in Little Italy .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>All the King’s Men</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 79 &middot; Location 970</div><div class='noteText'>“ To you guys from the coasts , the country is New York and LA . Everything in between is just the blur you fly over . But I’ll tell you , that blur is where the audience lives and where you make your money . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 86 &middot; Location 1064</div><div class='noteText'>“ I’ll tell you what you should do , ” he said . “ You should fix your problem . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 96 &middot; Location 1203</div><div class='noteText'>“ What the hell is happening ? ” I asked . “ We have to ask the Buddha what to do , ” he said . He rubbed the Buddha’s belly . He was such a con man . He said , “ Tell me , O great Buddha , do you think we should keep Jerry Weintraub ? Or should we let him go ? ” He closed his eyes , as if he were meditating , communicating with the sages , then said to me , “ The Buddha hasn’t made up his mind yet . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 98 &middot; Location 1225</div><div class='noteText'>There is a lesson in this : Let the other guy save face with his people , but keep score .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Old Blue Eyes</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 104 &middot; Location 1299</div><div class='noteText'>On that first tour , I learned something new almost every night . Watching Sinatra work an audience of twenty thousand , take them up , bring them down , leave them in a kind of ecstatic high helped me in the movie business later on . It taught me how to structure a story : act one , act two , act three . Where did I go to school ? Not to Harvard , Princeton , Stanford . I went to the school of Sinatra . I sat in his class every night . And while I was sitting there learning , I was making millions of dollars .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 114 &middot; Location 1447</div><div class='noteText'>tunnel that so many champions have walked before ,</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Firing Ferguson</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 122 &middot; Location 1531</div><div class='noteText'>It’s why I did not present John Denver as an exciting find , or as someone who had recently been playing to an empty house in Greenwich Village , but as talent that had already made it , an accomplished fact . I sold him in the past tense , as someone you’ve known about for years . I was telling the audience to relax and enjoy , as the judgment has already been made . You love him !</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 123 &middot; Location 1538</div><div class='noteText'>I convinced them to do a greatest - hits album , which was amazing , considering John only had one hit . This is what I mean by selling John as if he were already a star .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Jerry Weintraub Presents</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 132 &middot; Location 1648</div><div class='noteText'>Remember this ? It’s still really good ! They worked on their album for a year . When it was finished , I had beautiful invitations printed and carried by courier , with great pomp and circumstance , to journalists and critics all across the country . They read like tickets to an exclusive , impossible - to - get - into , one - time - only show by the geniuses behind your second - favorite band — Justin Hayward and John Lodge , playing at Carnegie Hall in New York City .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 136 &middot; Location 1704</div><div class='noteText'>He made his first fortune in commercial real estate , but his true talent had always been sales . Sell , earn , invest , increase .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 141 &middot; Location 1765</div><div class='noteText'>He loved me because I told him to go screw himself .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 141 &middot; Location 1769</div><div class='noteText'>He led me down the hall to an empty boardroom . There was a round table with ornate chairs and leather blotters and beautiful lamps with green shades , each throwing a pool of light . Arthur sat at the head of the table , struck the gavel , then said , “ Meeting in session . ” He read the main points of our contract aloud , asked if any members of the board were opposed , any objections , waited a moment , as if expecting an answer — “ Good news , ” he said to me , “ no objections ” — announced the contract ratified , then brought down the gavel , adjourning the meeting . “ I did that for a reason , ” he explained . “ I wanted to show you something . You’re going to make a lot of money . Do it yourself . Don’t ever go public . Be in charge of your own destiny . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 143 &middot; Location 1798</div><div class='noteText'>“ Don’t get hot , ” he said . “ I have every penny of it for you right here . You would have had it months ago if you had not been such a bastard and come here and been with me and talked to me and done business with me . You should have been here taking care of your business , ” he told me . “ You weren’t taking care of your business . This is a good lesson for you . ”</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Making Movies</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 169 &middot; Location 2103</div><div class='noteText'>See how life works ? A low - pressure system looms over the Atlantic , and I wind up making TV shows for CBS .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Family</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 172 &middot; Location 2137</div><div class='noteText'>No rehab , no counseling , nothing like that . Just a moment of clarity , in which I saw myself from the outside , the mess I was making , the waste . I was slipping , not working as hard as I used to . I started leaving the office early on Fridays , then skipping Fridays altogether . Then I started leaving early on Thursdays , then arriving late on Mondays . I was letting myself go . Then one day , I just decided , It has to stop . I threw away the pills and bottles , took a cold shower , had a barbershop shave , and stepped into the cool of Sunset Boulevard , and began fresh .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>The Producer</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 183 &middot; Location 2284</div><div class='noteText'>Well , yes , they said when it was done , it’s a nice little picture . Nice little picture ? No , I said , it’s a great film . But it will be huge only if we treat it like it’s huge .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Knowing Which Calls to Return</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 204 &middot; Location 2534</div><div class='noteText'>You have to be willing to walk away from the most comfortable perch , precisely because it is the most comfortable .</h3>

<h2 class='sectionHeading'>The Peanut Farmer</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 230 &middot; Location 2837</div><div class='noteText'>From Kennedy I learned that the best politicians are not different from movie stars . They charm , communicate , command . The good ones never make you feel isolated or small , as if they have something you don’t . Quite the opposite . They include you in their world , enlarge you , make you recognize the best qualities in yourself .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>If You Find Something You Love, Keep Doing It</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 245 &middot; Location 3005</div><div class='noteText'>People judge on first sight , so make those surfaces shine . If you want to be seen as a major , look like a major . As a great man said , perception is reality . As another great man said , You grow into the suit . As a philosophy this means operating on confidence , in the belief that something will happen , that the trick will work , that the backup will arrive with the heavy guns . It’s how America has operated from the beginning .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 247 &middot; Location 3043</div><div class='noteText'>Here’s what he said : “ You’ve got troubles , kid ? Real troubles ? Well , I tell you what . Put your troubles in a sack . Bring them to the end of the road , where you will find a lady in a store filled with sacks . She will take your sack of troubles and , in return , let you leave with any sack you want . ”</h3>

I see her all the time , and we’re on the phone constantly . I will be there whenever she needs me . Otherwise , I am off , in my own life . I think this works only because Jane had such a long and successful career . She was a singer , she was a star , she was a mother . She had many lifetimes without me and I have had many lifetimes without her .</h3>
