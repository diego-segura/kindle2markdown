<h2 class='sectionHeading'>I. Vagabonding</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 1. Declare Your Independence &gt; Page 4 &middot; Location 273</div><div class='noteText'>purchasing a package vacation to find a simpler life is kind of like using a mirror to see what you look like when you aren’t looking into the mirror . All that is really sold is the romantic notion of a simpler life , and — just as no amount of turning your head or flicking your eyes will allow you to unselfconsciously see yourself in the looking glass — no combination of one - week or ten - day vacations will truly take you away from the life you lead at home .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 1. Declare Your Independence &gt; Page 5 &middot; Location 287</div><div class='noteText'>Vagabonding is about using the prosperity and possibility of the information age to increase your personal options instead of your personal possessions .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>II. Getting Started</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 2. Earn Your Freedom &gt; Page 11 &middot; Location 311</div><div class='noteText'>If you have built castles in the air , your work need not be lost ; that is where they should be . Now put the foundations under them . — HENRY DAVID THOREAU , WALDEN</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 2. Earn Your Freedom &gt; Page 12 &middot; Location 321</div><div class='noteText'>Most of us , of course , have never taken such vows — but we choose to live like monks anyway , rooting ourselves to a home or a career and using the future as a kind of phony ritual that justifies the present .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 2. Earn Your Freedom &gt; Page 14 &middot; Location 351</div><div class='noteText'>gumption</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 2. Earn Your Freedom &gt; Page 15 &middot; Location 379</div><div class='noteText'>Work is not just an activity that generates funds and creates desire ; it’s the vagabonding gestation period , wherein you earn your integrity , start making plans , and get your proverbial act together . Work is a time to dream about travel and write notes to yourself , but it’s also the time to tie up your loose ends . Work is when you confront the problems you might otherwise be tempted to run away from . Work is how you settle your financial and emotional debts — so that your travels are not an escape from your real life but a discovery of your real life .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 2. Earn Your Freedom &gt; Page 20 &middot; Location 414</div><div class='noteText'>A vacation , after all , merely rewards work . Vagabonding justifies it .</h3>

Earn Your Freedom &gt; Page 20 &middot; Location 425</div><div class='noteText'>if the clock appears to move faster than it did in sixth grade , it’s only because we haven’t actualized our power as adults to set our own recess schedule .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 2. Earn Your Freedom &gt; Page 20 &middot; Location 427</div><div class='noteText'>To actualize this power , we merely need to make strategic use ( if only for a few weeks or months ) of a time - honored personal - freedom technique , popularly known as “ quitting . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 2. Earn Your Freedom &gt; Page 20 &middot; Location 444</div><div class='noteText'>As Pico Iyer pointed out , the act of quitting “ means not giving up , but moving on ; changing direction not because something doesn’t agree with you , but because you don’t agree with something . It’s not a complaint , in other words , but a positive choice , and not a stop in one’s journey , but a step in a better direction . Quitting — whether a job or a habit — means taking a turn so as to be sure you’re still moving in the direction of your dreams . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 3. Keep It Simple &gt; Page 33 &middot; Location 661</div><div class='noteText'>Indeed , the freedom to go vagabonding has never been determined by income level ; it’s found through simplicity — the conscious decision of how to use what income you have .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 3. Keep It Simple &gt; Page 37 &middot; Location 714</div><div class='noteText'>As with , say , giving up coffee , simplifying your life will require a somewhat difficult consumer withdrawal period . Fortunately , your impending travel experience will give you a very tangible and rewarding long - term goal that helps ease the discomfort . Over time , as you reap the sublime rewards of simplicity , you’ll begin to wonder how you ever put up with such a cluttered life in the first place .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 3. Keep It Simple &gt; Page 37 &middot; Location 722</div><div class='noteText'>three general methods to simplifying your life : stopping expansion , reining in your routine , and reducing clutter .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 3. Keep It Simple &gt; Page 38 &middot; Location 741</div><div class='noteText'>As a matter of fact , any man who can obviously afford a car but genuinely prefers travels or a good library will in the end be much more respected than if he behaved exactly like everyone else . — BERTRAND RUSSELL , THE CONQUEST OF HAPPINESS</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 3. Keep It Simple &gt; Page 39 &middot; Location 757</div><div class='noteText'>It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion ; it is easy in solitude to live after your own ; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude . — RALPH WALDO EMERSON , “ SELF - RELIANCE ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 3. Keep It Simple &gt; Page 50 &middot; Location 930</div><div class='noteText'>Here’s a fun , money - saving trick I use : I give up some luxury at home , and instead visualize an experience I could only have on the road . Instead of going out for steak , I picture the sushi I could be eating in Osaka . Instead of buying another guitar , I envision scuba diving a coral reef in the Philippines . The imagination is a powerful tool . I use it to feast on all the possibilities awaiting me on my trip — and my wallet never leaves my pocket . — DEREK ORTH , 28 , VOICE ACTOR , FLORIDA</h3>

Learn, and Keep Learning &gt; Page 60 &middot; Location 1094</div><div class='noteText'>Some vagabonders , in an effort to travel as light as possible , even go so far as to slice out entire portions of their guidebook if they don’t plan on using them .</h3>

Don’t Set Limits &gt; Page 93 &middot; Location 1559</div><div class='noteText'>Traveler , there is no path , paths are made by walking . — ANTONIO MACHADO , CANTARES</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 5. Don’t Set Limits &gt; Page 106 &middot; Location 1754</div><div class='noteText'>Never check into a room without asking to see it first . Check to see that the electricity and water work properly , and make sure the door locks are functional . Note the location of your room in relation to discos , mosques , factories , major streets , or other surroundings that might prove noisy at certain times of the day or night .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 5. Don’t Set Limits &gt; Page 107 &middot; Location 1764</div><div class='noteText'>Nearly every other product and service on the planet ( from hotels to souvenirs to market goods ) is open to negotiation — and only a fool would accept an opening price without haggling a little .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 6. Meet Your Neighbors &gt; Page 115 &middot; Location 1882</div><div class='noteText'>My students seemed to enjoy this unusual study environment , but they always clammed up when I referred to them as my “ friends . ” “ We are not your friends , ” one studious sophomore insisted . “ We will never be your friends . ” Her response , which I initially took as hostility toward me as a non - Korean , left me feeling depressed . It wasn’t until months later that I finally came to understand how the Korean notion of friendship is vastly different than that of the West . By their Confucian system of manners , “ friendship ” is reserved for people of similar social standing — and to regard a teacher as a “ friend ” ( rather than a superior ) would be a grave insult for both parties .</h3>

Get into Adventures &gt; Page 147 &middot; Location 2365</div><div class='noteText'>“ Good people keep walking whatever happens , ” taught the Buddha . “ They do not speak vain words and are the same in good fortune and bad . ”</h3>

Keep It Real &gt; Page 160 &middot; Location 2535</div><div class='noteText'>This difference between looking and seeing on the road is frequently summed up with two somewhat opposable terms : tourist and traveler .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 8. Keep It Real &gt; Page 161 &middot; Location 2541</div><div class='noteText'>“ The traveler sees what he sees , ” wrote G . K . Chesterton in the 1920s , “ the tourist sees what he has come to see . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 8. Keep It Real &gt; Page 167 &middot; Location 2640</div><div class='noteText'>“ While I complain of being able to glimpse no more than the shadow of the past , ” he wrote in Tristes Tropiques , “ I may be insensitive to reality as it is taking shape at this very moment … . A few hundred years hence , in this same place , another traveler , as despairing as myself , will mourn the disappearance of what I might have seen , but failed to see . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 8. Keep It Real &gt; Page 169 &middot; Location 2678</div><div class='noteText'>As Salvador Dalí quipped , “ I never took drugs because I am drugs . ”</h3>
