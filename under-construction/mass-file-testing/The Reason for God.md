> I personally take the view that Genesis 1 and 2 relate to each other the way Judges 4 and 5 and Exodus 14 and 15 do. In each couplet one chapter describes a historical event and the other is a song or poem about the theological meaning of the event. When reading Judges 4 it is obvious that it is a sober recounting of what happened in the battle, but when we read Judges 5, Deborah’s Song about the battle, the language is poetic and metaphorical.

> This is a classic case of ignoring the cultural and historical distance between us and the writer and readers of the original text. In the first- century Roman empire, when the New Testament was written, there was not a great difference between slaves and the average free person. Slaves were not distinguishable from others by race, speech, or clothing. They looked and lived like most everyone else, and were not segregated from the rest of society in any way. From a financial standpoint, slaves made the same wages as free laborers, and therefore were not usually poor. Also, slaves could accrue enough personal capital to buy themselves out. Most important of all, very few slaves were slaves for life. Most could reasonably hope to be manumitted within ten or fifteen years, or by their late thirties at the latest. 22 By contrast, New World slavery was much more systematically and homogeneously brutal

Isn’t that at least a clue that this “something ” that we want exists? 15 This unfulfillable longing, then, qualifies as a deep, innate human desire, and that makes it a major clue that God is there.

But if reason is a product of natural selection, then how much confidence can we have in a rational argument for natural selection? The power of reason is owed to the independence of reason, and to nothing else …. Evolutionary biology cannot invoke the power of reason even as it destroys it. 29 It comes down to this: If, as the evolutionary scientists say, what our brains tells us about morality, love, and beauty is not real— if it is merely a set of chemical reactions designed to pass on our genetic code— then so is what their brains tell them about the world. Then why should they trust them?

Both women agreed and sought to forgive. However, the woman who had the worst husband and who was the least religious was able to forgive. The other woman was not. This puzzled me for months until one day the unforgiving woman blurted out, “Well, if my son goes down the drain then my whole life will have been a failure! ” She had centered her life on her son’s happiness and success. That was why she couldn’t forgive.

> From the outside that might sound coercive, like a grinding obligation. From the inside the motivation is all joy. Think of what happens when you fall in love. Your love makes you eager for acceptance from the beloved. You ask, “Do you want to go out? ” or maybe even, “Will you marry me? ” What happens when the answer is “Yes ”? Do you say, “Great! I’m in! Now I can act any way I want ”? Of course not. Now you don’t even wait for the object of your affection to directly ask you to do something for them. You anticipate whatever pleases and delights them. There’s no coercion or sense of obligation, yet your behavior has been radically changed by the mind and heart of the person you love.

He began to do with us what he had been doing with the Father and the Spirit from all eternity. He centers upon us, loving us without benefit to himself.
