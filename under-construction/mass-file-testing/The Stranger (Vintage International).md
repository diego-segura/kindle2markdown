> He’d told me that they had to bury her quickly, because it gets hot in the plains, especially in this part of the country. That was when he told me he had lived in Paris and that he had found it hard to forget it. In Paris they keep vigil over the body for three, sometimes four days. But here you barely have time to get used to the idea before you have to start running after the hearse.

> Several other images from that day have stuck in my mind: for instance, Pérez’s face when he caught up with us for the last time, just outside the village. Big tears of frustration and exhaustion were streaming down his cheeks. But because of all the wrinkles, they weren’t dripping off. They spread out and ran together again, leaving a watery film over his ruined face. Then there was the church and the villagers on the sidewalks, the red geraniums on the graves in the cemetery, Pérez fainting ( he crumpled like a rag doll ), the blood- red earth spilling over Maman’s casket, the white flesh of the roots mixed in with it, more people, voices, the village, waiting in front of a café, the incessant drone of the motor, and my joy when the bus entered the nest of lights that was Algiers and I knew I was going to go to bed and sleep for twelve hours.

> I felt like telling her it wasn’t my fault, but I stopped myself because I remembered that I’d already said that to my boss. It didn’t mean anything. Besides, you always feel a little guilty.

> I shut my windows, and as I was coming back I glanced at the mirror and saw a corner of my table with my alcohol lamp next to some pieces of bread. It occurred to me that anyway one more Sunday was over, that Maman was buried now, that I was going back to work, and that, really, nothing had changed.

> Céleste was there, as always, with his big belly, his apron, and his white moustache. He asked me if things were “all right now. ” I told him yes they were and said I was hungry. I ate fast and had some coffee. Then I went home and slept for a while because I’d drunk too much wine, and when I woke up I felt like having a smoke.

> But I went straight home because I wanted to boil myself some potatoes.

> And once he said to me, talking about Salamano, “If that isn’t pitiful! ” He asked me didn’t I think it was disgusting and I said no.

> I didn’t mind being his pal, and he seemed set on it.

> When she laughed I wanted her again. A minute later she asked me if I loved her. I told her it didn’t mean anything but that I didn’t think so. She looked sad. But as we were fixing lunch, and for no apparent reason, she laughed in such a way that I kissed her.

> I said that people never change their lives, that in any case one life was as good as another and that I wasn’t dissatisfied with mine here at all. He looked upset and told me that I never gave him a straight answer, that I had no ambition, and that that was disastrous in business. So I went back to work. I would rather not have upset him, but I couldn’t see any reason to change my life. Looking back on it, I wasn’t unhappy. When I was a student, I had lots of ambitions like that. But when I had to give up my studies I learned very quickly that none of it really mattered.

> On my way out I was even going to shake his hand, but just in time, I remembered that I had killed a man.

> I was almost surprised that I had ever enjoyed anything other than those rare moments when the judge would lead me to the door of his office, slap me on the shoulder, and say to me cordially, “That’s all for today, Monsieur Antichrist. ’ I would then be handed back over to the police.

> At the time, I often thought that if I had had to live in the trunk of a dead tree, with nothing to do but look up at the sky flowering overhead, little by little I would have gotten used to it. I would have waited for birds to fly by or clouds to mingle, just as here I waited to see my lawyer’s ties and just as, in another world, I used to wait patiently until Saturday to hold Marie’s body in my arms.

> A man had left a Czech village to seek his fortune. Twenty- five years later, and now rich, he had returned with a wife and a child. His mother was running a hotel with his sister in the village where he’d been born. In order to surprise them, he had left his wife and child at another hotel and gone to see his mother, who didn’t recognize him when he walked in. As a joke he’d had the idea of taking a room. He had shown off his money. During the night his mother and his sister had beaten him to death with a hammer in order to rob him and had thrown his body in the river. The next morning the wife had come to the hotel and, without knowing it, gave away the traveler’s identity. The mother hanged herself. The sister threw herself down a well. I must have read that story a thousand times.

Page 80 - Location 878

> Anyway, I thought the traveler pretty much deserved what he got and that you should never play games.

> It was then I felt a stirring go through the room and for the first time I realized that I was guilty.

Page 91 - Location 996

> The prosecutor asked him if he had at least seen me cry. Pérez answered no. The prosecutor in turn said, “The gentlemen of the jury will take note. ” But my lawyer got angry. He asked Pérez in what seemed to be an exaggerated tone of voice if he had seen me not cry. Pérez said, “No. ” The spectators laughed.

> Even in the prisoner’s dock it’s always interesting to hear people talk about you.

—

Page 98 - Location 1074

> Besides, I have to admit that whatever interest you can get people to take in you doesn’t last very long. For example, I got bored very quickly with the prosecutor’s speech. Only bits and pieces— a gesture or a long but isolated tirade— caught my attention or aroused my interest.

—

Page 100 - Location 1093

> Of course, I couldn’t help admitting that he was right. I didn’t feel much remorse for what I’d done. But I was surprised by how relentless he was. I would have liked to have tried explaining to him cordially, almost affectionately, that I had never been able to truly feel remorse for anything.

—

Page 110 - Location 1194

> How had I not seen that there was nothing more important than an execution, and that when you come right down to it, it was the only thing a man could truly be interested in?

Page 116 - Location 1260

> “Why have you refused to see me? ” he asked. I said that I didn’t believe in God. He wanted to know if I was sure and I said that I didn’t see any reason to ask myself that question: it seemed unimportant.

—

Page 116 - Location 1265

> He looked away and without moving asked me if I wasn’t talking that way out of extreme despair. I explained to him that I wasn’t desperate. I was just afraid, which was only natural.

—

Page 120 - Location 1311

> He wasn’t even sure he was alive, because he was living like a dead man. Whereas it looked as if I was the one who’d come up emptyhanded. But I was sure about me, about everything, surer than he could ever be, sure of my life and sure of the death I had waiting for me. Yes, that was all I had.

Page 122 - Location 1331

> For the first time in a long time I thought about Maman. I felt as if I understood why at the end of her life she had taken a “fiance, ” why she had played at beginning again. Even there, in that home where lives were fading out, evening was a kind of wistful respite. So close to death, Maman must have felt free then and ready to live it all again.

Page 122 - Location 1334

> I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world. Finding it so much like myself— so like a brother, really— I felt that I had been happy and that I was happy again.
