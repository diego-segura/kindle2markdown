> When you write anything longer than a few paragraphs, start by telling the reader where you are going. The committee proposes that the company invest $1 million in a library. First you must know where you are going yourself. Make an outline of your major points, placing supporting details in their proper position. Then, in your paper, use your outline to signal the major points for your reader. Underline and number each important section heading. This serves the same purpose as chapter titles in a book. End with a summary. And keep in mind that a summary is not a conclusion. Your summary should introduce no new ideas; it should summarize, as briefly as possible, the most important points you have made. If your paper comes to a conclusion— the point of your case— your summary should summarize that too, to fix the essentials of your message in your reader’s mind. Summary: Make an outline; use your outline to help your reader; number and underline section headings; summarize.

Here is a statement from a report by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission: It would be prudent to consider expeditiously the provision of instrumentation that would provide an unambiguous indication of the level of fluid in the reactor vessel. If you break that idea into two sentences, and follow other suggestions in this chapter, you might end up with something like this: We should make up our minds quickly about getting better gauges. Good gauges would tell us exactly how much fluid is in the reactor vessel.

> Consider the surprising bestselling business book Who Moved My Cheese?— an allegory about change by Spencer Johnson. It’s a simple, almost corny, story about two small mice and two small humans who live in a maze where they find cheese, and how they respond when one day their cheese isn’t where it used to be.
