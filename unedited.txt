I called Bill Campbell to tell him the good news : The deal was signed and we would be announcing it in New York on Monday . He replied , “ Too bad you can’t go to New York and be part of the announcement ; you’ll have to send Marc . ” I said , “ What do you mean ? ” He said , “ You need to stay home and make sure everybody knows where they stand . You can’t wait a day . In fact , you can’t wait a minute . They need to know whether they are working for you , EDS , or looking for a fucking job . ” Damn . He was right . I sent Marc to New York and prepared to let people know where they stood . That small piece of advice from Bill proved to be the foundation we needed to rebuild the company . If we hadn’t treated the people who were leaving fairly , the people who stayed would never have trusted me again . Only a CEO who had been through some awful , horrible , devastating circumstances would know to give that advice at that time .
